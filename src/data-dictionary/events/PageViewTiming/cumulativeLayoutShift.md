An important, user-centric metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience unexpected layout shiftsâ€”a low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful. 

Cumulative Layout Shift is one of three metrics identified by Google as the Core Web Vitals. CLS scores up to 0.1 are considered "Good", between 0.1-0.25 considered "Needs Improvement", and above 0.25 considered "Poor."
