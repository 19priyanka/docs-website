<h2>Problem</h2>[Custom violation description tags](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/alert-custom-violation-descriptions#example) are not being replaced by the values from the event.
<h2>Solution</h2><p>Tags are only available for events that are indexed by New Relic.</p>

<p>The easiest way to know whether an event is indexed is to run the query <code>SELECT nr.entityType FROM ${EventSampleName}</code>, replacing <code>${EventSampleName}</code> with the name of the event in question.</p>

<p>If there are values in the column <code>nr.entity Type</code>&nbsp;of the result, then the event is indexed. Otherwise it is not.</p>

<h2>Cause</h2><p>It is not possible to add a description to any sample that does not get indexed in New Relic.</p>
