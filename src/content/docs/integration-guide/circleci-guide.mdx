Configure the [CircleCI Webhook](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/webhooks/) service to send CICD Logs to New Relic.


## Set up webhook trigger in CircleCI

To set up a CircleCI webhook logpush to New Relic:

1. Log in to [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/projects)

2. Visit a specific project you have setup on CircleCI.

3. Click on Project Settings.

4. In the sidebar of your Project Settings, click on Webhooks.

5. Click Add Webhook.

6. Fill out the name of the webhook.

7. Enter New Relic's **Logs Endpoint**:

   US: `"https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>"`

   EU: `"https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1?Api-Key=<NR_LICENSE_KEY>"`

   Use the region you set on your New Relic account. Replace `<NR_LICENSE_KEY>` with your New Relic license key, which you can [retrieve from the UI or API](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#manage-license-key).

8. Select either Workflow or Job, depending on which event you want to trigger the logpush from.

9. Provided your receiving API or third party service is set up, click Test Ping Event to dispatch a test event.
