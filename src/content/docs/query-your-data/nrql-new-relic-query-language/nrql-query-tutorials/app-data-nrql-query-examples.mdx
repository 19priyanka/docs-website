You can use NRQL to query the application data collected by [New Relic APM](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#transaction-defaults), [New Relic Browser](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#browser-defaults), and [New Relic Mobile](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#mobile-defaults). You can then use this data to answer a variety of questions. Here are some basic examples.

## Unique users

How many unique user sessions did you have in the last week?

```
SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago
```

## Unique user trends

Were your unique user sessions up or down last week compared to the week before?

```
SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago
```

## Pageview trends [#pageview-trend-graphs]

How can I graph the number of unique users yesterday compared to the day before?

```
SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago TIMESERIES AUTO
```

## OS version [#os-version-example]

How many of your mobile users are on the latest OS version?

```
SELECT uniqueCount(uuid) FROM MobileSession FACET osVersion SINCE 7 days ago
```

## Key account Apdex [#key-acct-apdex]

What is the [Apdex score](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) for a particularly important customer? If you have [defined some custom attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes), you can query to monitor how this customer experiences your app from a performance standpoint:

```
SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago
```
