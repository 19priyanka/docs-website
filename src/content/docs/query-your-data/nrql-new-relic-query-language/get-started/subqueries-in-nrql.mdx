title: Subqueries in NRQL
metaDescription: "How to use subqueries in NRQL, the New Relic query language"
---

Do you want to perform calculations on the child entities of a parent entity? Or see error logs for hosts with high CPU load based on the infrastructure agent’s CPU utilization? With subqueries these examples and more are possible.

## Subquery Basics [#subquery-basics]

A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query. In NRQL, subqueries can appear in the [SELECT](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#state-select) statement and [WHERE](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-where) clause. Subqueries allow using the result from one query in another query.

**Example:** Find the count of transactions whose duration was greater than average:
```
SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE duration > (SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction)
```

A subquery's results must make sense in context. In the example above, the greater-than condition in the `WHERE` clause requires a subquery that returns a single value. A subquery that returns a set of values (e.g. a [uniques()](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-uniques) subquery) would fail.

A subquery may be nested inside another subquery. A maximum of three subqueries, nested or unnested, is allowed in a query.

The subquery's time range will be the same as the outer query's, unless explicitly specified with [SINCE](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-since)/[UNTIL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-until). 

## Subquery Execution [#subquery-execution]

During query execution, each subquery is run independently, and its result is used as a constant value--or set of values--in the outer query. Due to this execution model, subqueries may not reference attributes and values from the outer query.

The [query duration limit](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries/#query-duration) is honored for queries with subqueries. This means that all subqueries and the outer query must complete execution within the duration limit.

The maximum number of results a subquery can return is the same as the maximum query [LIMIT](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-limit) value, 2,000.

## Subqueries vs. Nested Aggregation [#subquery-vs-nested-aggregation]

Though they appear similar, subqueries shouldn’t be confused with [nested aggregations](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/nested-aggregation-make-ordered-computations-single-query/), which allow the aggregation of the result of a nested query. Nested aggregations are used in the `FROM` clause, while subqueries are used in the `SELECT` statement and `WHERE` clause.

## Limitations [#subquery-limitations]

* Subqueries aren't supported in NRQL alert conditions. Because queries with subqueries require making multiple passes over data, subqueries are incompatible with streaming alerts.
* The `TIMESERIES` and `COMPARE WITH` clauses, which cause queries to return multiple sets of results, are not supported in subqueries.
* Subqueries can't appear in the `FACET` clause, though they can appear in the `WHERE` clauses used in `FACET CASES`.

## Examples [#subquery-examples]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser title="Numeric conditions">
    Any query which returns a single numeric value, such as those using the aggregators `average()`, `count()`, `uniqueCount()`, or `latest()`, can be used in numeric conditions.

    Find the count of transactions whose duration was greater than average:

    ```
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE duration > (FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration))
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="IN conditions">
    Any query which returns a set of values, including those using `uniques()`, can be used in an `IN` condition.

    Calculate the average duration of transactions that are children of a particular entity:

    ```
    FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) WHERE entityGuid IN (FROM Relationship SELECT targetEntityGuid WHERE sourceEntityGuid = 'MjUyMDUyOHxOUjF8V09SS0xPQUR8NzYzMDQ' AND relationshipType = 'CONTAINS') SINCE 1 day ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="String condition with a faceted subquery">
    When using a comparison operator (`=`, `!=`, `<`, etc.) with a faceted subquery, `LIMIT 1` must be specified in order to limit the result to a single value.

    Find transaction errors associated with the latest transaction for the account with the highest average transaction duration:

    ```
    FROM TransactionError SELECT * WHERE guid = (FROM Transaction SELECT latest(guid) FACET accountId ORDER BY average(duration) LIMIT 1)
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="Delta query">
    Subquery results may be used in calculations in the `SELECT` statement. A subquery may specify a different time range from the outer query.

    Chart the difference between the current average transaction duration and the average duration over the last week:

    ```
    FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) - (FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 7 days ago) TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="Multiple subqueries">
    Up to three subqueries may appear in a single query.

    Find the unique accounts responsible for transactions whose duration was greater than the 99th percentile:

    ```
    FROM Transaction SELECT uniques(accountId) WHERE guid IN (FROM Transaction SELECT uniques(guid) WHERE duration > (FROM Transaction SELECT percentile(duration, 99)))
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="Subquery as a function argument">
    Many NRQL functions can take a subquery as an argument.

    Build a string showing individual transaction duration compared to the average:

    ```
    SELECT concat('This transaction duration: ', duration, '; average transaction duration: ', (SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction), precision: 4) FROM Transaction
    ```
  </Collapser>
