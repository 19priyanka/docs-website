With our Flink dashboards, you can easily track your Flink logs, keep an eye on your instrumentation sources, and overview uptime and downtime for all your applications' instances. Built with our infrastructure agent and our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, Flink dashboards take advantage of OpenMetrics endpoint scraping, so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

After setting up Flink with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install Prometheus OpenMetrics

Before getting Flink data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing Prometheus OpenMetrics. If you haven't already:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=3501165&state=a33ce5fc-d32b-e0b8-3941-30f13e4bc00b) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. Or if you prefer, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
* Configure the `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file by adding the following snippet anywhere to the file:

```yml
integrations:
- name: nri-prometheus
    config:
    standalone: false
    # Defaults to true. When standalone is set to `false`, `nri-prometheus` requires an infrastructure agent to send data.
    emitters: infra-sdk
    # When running with infrastructure agent emitters will have to include infra-sdk
    cluster_name: <var>YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME_HERE</var>
    # Match the name of your cluster with the name seen in New Relic. 
    targets:
        - description: Secure etcd example
        - urls: ["https://192.168.3.1:2379", "https://192.168.3.2:2379", "https://192.168.3.3:2379"]
        tls_config:
        ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
        cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
        key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"
    - verbose: false
    # Defaults to false. This determines whether or not the integration should run in verbose mode.
    - audit: false
    # Defaults to false and does not include verbose mode. Audit mode logs the uncompressed data sent to New Relic and can lead to a high log volume.
    - scrape_timeout: <var>YOUR_TIMEOUT_DURATION</var>
    # Defaults to 30s. The HTTP client timeout when fetching data from endpoints.
    scrape_duration: "5s"
    # Time to distribute the scraping from the endpoints.

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with many (>400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
      # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
      # many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false.
      insecure_skip_verify: false

    timeout: 10s

```

## Get Flink metrics as dashboards

Once you've installed the [Flink quickstart](), you can see your critical Flink data in New Relic.
