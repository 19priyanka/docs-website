With our Flink dashboards, you can easily track your Flink logs, keep an eye on your instrumentation sources, and get a total overview of your application's uptime and downtime for all instances. Built with our infrastructure agent and our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, Flink dashboards take advantage of Prometheus scraping so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

After setting up Flink with New Relic, your data will display in dashboards like these, right out of the box.

## Install Prometheus OpenMetrics

Before getting Flink data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing the JMX integration. If you haven't already:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=3501165&state=a33ce5fc-d32b-e0b8-3941-30f13e4bc00b) to instrument your system with the infrastructure agent. Or if you prefer, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
* Configure the `nri-prometheus-config.yml` file by adding the following snippet anywhere to the file:

```
integrations:
- name: nri-prometheus
    config:
        standalone: false
        emitters: infra-sdk
        cluster_name: "my_exporter"
    targets:
        - description: Flink metrics are captured in the below urls
            urls: ["'job-cluster:9249', 'taskmanager1:9249', 'taskmanager2:9249'"]
        tls_config:
            ca_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client-ca.crt"
            cert_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.crt"
            key_file_path: "/etc/etcd/etcd-client.key"
    verbose: false
scrape_timeout: "30s"

      # Number of worker threads used for scraping targets.
      # For large clusters with many (>400) endpoints, slowly increase until scrape
      # time falls between the desired `scrape_duration`.
      # Increasing this value too much will result in huge memory consumption if too
      # many metrics are being scraped.
      # Default: 4
      # worker_threads: 4

      # Whether the integration should skip TLS verification or not. Defaults to false.
      insecure_skip_verify: false

    timeout: 10s

```

## Get Flink metrics as dashboards

Once you've installed the [Flink quickstart](), you can see your critical Flink data in New Relic.
