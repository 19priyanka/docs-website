With our ActiveMQ dashboard, easily track your ActiveMQ logs, keep an eye on your critical brokers, and get a total overview of all components of your messaging system. Built with our Linux infrastructure agent and our JMX integration, ActiveMQ dashboards take advantage of JMX scraping so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

## Set up the JMX integration [#setup]

Before getting ActiveMQ data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing the JMX integration. If you haven't already:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=3501165&state=ff641d8b-e722-855e-4c4a-c50c23969dc3) to instrument your system with the Linux infrastructure agent. Or, if you prefer, [install the Linux infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
* Install the [JMX monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/jmx-monitoring-integration).

## Send your ActiveMQ data to New Relic [#send]

Our ActiveMQ dashboard takes data scraped from your JMX integration and translates it into a collection of premade graphs and charts. Having all your data housed in the New Relic Platform gives you a true bird's eye view of your system's health and critical business points.
