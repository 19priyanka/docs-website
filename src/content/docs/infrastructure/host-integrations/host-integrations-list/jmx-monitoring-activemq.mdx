With our ActiveMQ dashboard, easily track your ActiveMQ logs, keep an eye on your critical brokers, and get a total overview of all components of your messaging system. Built with our Linux infrastructure agent and our JMX integration, ActiveMQ dashboards take advantage of JMX scraping so you can view all your most important data, all in one place.

## Set up the JMX integration [#setup]

Before getting ActiveMQ data into New Relic, first install our infrastructure agent, then expose your metrics by installing the JMX integration. If you haven't already:

* Follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=3501165&state=ff641d8b-e722-855e-4c4a-c50c23969dc3) to instrument your system with the Linux infrastructure agent. Or, if you prefer, [install the Linux infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
* Install the [JMX monitoring integration](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/jmx-monitoring-integration).

## Send your ActiveMQ data to New Relic [#send]

Our ActiveMQ dashboard takes data scraped from your JMX integration and translates it into a collection of premade graphs and charts. Having all your data housed in the New Relic Platform gives you a true bird's eye view of your system's health and critical business points.

    title="Step 1. Update the `jmx-config.yml` file"
  >
The below YAML snippet connects your ActiveMQ metrics via `CONNECTION_URL` to jconsole, a Java tool that makes those metrics readable. If you're following along with the JMX integration install, this step corresponds with the configuration step in the JMX install flow. 

To update: 

1. Navigate to file path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jmx-config.yml`
2. Add this snippet:

```yml
integrations:
- name: nri-jmx
  env:
    COLLECTION_FILES: "/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jmx-config.yml"
    JMX_HOST: 127.0.0.1
    JMX_PASS: admin
    JMX_PORT: 8161
    JMX_user: admin
    CONNECTION_URL: "service:jmx:rmi://127.0.0.1:1098/jndi/rmi://127.0.0.1:1099/jmxrmi"
    REMOTE_MONITORING: "true"
  interval: 15s
  labels:
    env: staging
```

    title="Step 2. Update the `jvm-metrics` with ActiveMQ metric names"
  >
This step organizes your metrics to be human readable once inside the New Relic platform. To update `jvm metrics`:

1. Navigate to file path `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml`
2. Add this snippet:

```yml
collect:
  - domain: java.lang
  event_type: JVMSampleActiveMQ
  beans:
    - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=*
      attributes:
        - CollectionCount
        - CollectionTime
    -query: type=Memory
      attributes:
        - HeapMemoryUsage.Committed
        - HeapMemoryUsage.Init
        - HeapMemoryUsage.Max
        - HeapMemoryUsage.Used
        - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed
        - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init
        - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max
        - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used
    - query: type=Threading
      attributes:
        - ThreadCount
        - TotalStartedThreadCount
    - query: type=ClassLoading
      attributes:
        - LoadedClassCount
    - query: type=Compilation
      attributes:
        - TotalCompilationTime
```
  </Collapser>

    title="Step 3. Forward your ActiveMQ logs"
  >
With your monitoring environment set up, forward your ActiveMQ logs to the New Relic Platform. To forward logs:

1. Navigate to your ActiveMQ `logging.yml` file.
2. Add this snippet anywhere to the file:

```yml
- name: activemq.log
  file: /opt/activemq/data/activemq.log
  attributes:
    logtype: activemq-log
- name: activemq_audit.log
  file: /opt/activemq/data/activemq.log
  attributes:
    logtype: activemq-audit-log
```
