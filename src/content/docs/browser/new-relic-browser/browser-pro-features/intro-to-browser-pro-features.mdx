metaDescription: 'The features associated with the New Relic Browser Pro agent'
---

There are three [types of New Relic browser agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#agent-types): Lite, Pro, and Pro+SPA. When enabling New Relic browser monitoring, by default the Pro+SPA browser agent is installed but some customers will have another agent type because: 

* Some older customers started out with another version, or
* They've downgraded to a different agent type

The [Browser Pro docs](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features) explain the features available for the Pro and Pro+SPA agent types. For more information, see [Agent types](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent#agent-types).
