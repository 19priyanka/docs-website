import browserSummaryPage from 'images/browser_summary_page.png'

Our browser monitoring's **Summary** page summarizes the real-user browser performance of your app. Use the **Summary** page to:

* Get core web vitals at a glance, including largest contentful paint (LCP), first input delay (FID), and cumulative layout shift (CLS)
* View trends in an app's browser-side performance
* Quickly troubleshoot page load timing issues
* Navigate to other browser UI pages

## View the Summary page [#viewing]

To view a summary of browser performance for an app:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click **Browser**, and select an app.
2. From the selected app's **Summary** page, use [standard New Relic page functions](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/) to drill down into detailed information.
3. To get even more details, click any chart's title.

## Use core web vitals data to improve SEO [#core_vitals]

The **Core web vitals** charts show how your browser performs according to [Google's Core Web Vitals](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/pageviewtiming-async-or-dynamic-page-details). These include:

* LCP: Largest contentful paint, which measures loading performance
* FID: First input delay, which measures interactivity between user input and browser response
* CLS: Cumulative layout shift, which measures visual stability in the browser page

Higher scores can help your organization save money and influence SEO. Lower scores can affect your users' perceptions of your organization's website, which could result in dissatisfied customers or lost business opportunities.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To ensure you're hitting the recommended target for most of your users, a good threshold to measure is the 75th percentile of page loads, segmented across mobile and desktop devices.

Learn how to use the core web vitals you see in the UI by checking out our [self-paced training course at learn.newrelic.com](https://learn.newrelic.com/self-paced-core-web-vitals). The course covers:

* What each core web vital metric measures
* What are the recommended thresholds for each
* What are some common causes that affect the metrics and their respective value rating
* How to collect timing metrics that you'll be able to review in the browser monitoring UI
* How to query the data in order to understand a user's experience on a website

## Locate performance problems [#throughput]

Use these charts to help identify performance problems with your app:

* The **Throughput** chart displays browser throughput as pages per minute (ppm). The value in the upper right of the chart is the average value for the selected time range.
* If you have enabled [SPA monitoring](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/get-started/welcome-single-page-app-monitoring) and the **Summary** page shows the **SPA load time** chart, the **Throughput** chart will also use SPA data.

<Callout variant="tip">
  App server requests per minute (rpm) may show a different measurement than the browser [page load timing](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing/page-load-timing-process)'s pages per minute (ppm).
</Callout>

The **Initial page load and route change** chart shows the load time of a traditional URL change stemming from a load or reload of a URL. This chart appears with more detail about the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) on the [page load time page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/page-views-dashboard).

The **Front end vs. back end** chart links to the connected APM service application. For details on APM and tracing, see [Language agents and distributed tracing](docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing).

The **Related entities** widget shows all the entities that are related to the browser. To understand more about connections between entities, read about [entity relationships](docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#related-entities).

## Evaluate user experience [#user_time]

Use these charts to help evaluate how good is your users' experience with your app:

* The **User time on the site** widget shows the time a user remains on the site.
* The **User-centric page load times** chart shows the load time of a page for a user. This chart appears with more detail about the [page load timing process](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-resources/page-load-timing-process) on the [page load time page](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/dashboard-details/page-views-dashboard).
* The **View synthetic monitors** button directs you to the **Synthetics** page. [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/) can simulate user traffic. This helps you to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice.
