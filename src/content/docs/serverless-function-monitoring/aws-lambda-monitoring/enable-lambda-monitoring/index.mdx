There are several steps to enabling Lambda monitoring:

1. [Link your AWS Account](account-linking)
   1. Link your AWS Account with your New Relic account. This allows New Relic to gather metadata about
      your Lambda functions (and, optionally, other AWS Resources), to link with your telemetry.
   2. Add your New Relic License Key to AWS Secrets Manager, so that your functions can send telemetry to New Relic.
2. Optionally, configure [CloudWatch Log collection](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs).
   The `newrelic-lambda` CLI will automatically install the CloudWatch logs collector by default.
3. [Instrument a function](instrument-example).
4. [Instrument other functions](instrument-your-own).
