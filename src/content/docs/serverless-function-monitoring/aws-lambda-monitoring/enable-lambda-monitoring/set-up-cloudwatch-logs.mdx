title: "Step 2: Set up AWS CloudWatch log collection"
metaDescription: An optional step of setting up CloudWatch logs when enabling New Relic's AWS Lambda monitoring.
---

In Step 1, if you used the newrelic-lambda CLI, it checked whether you had installed either the [Metric Streams](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream) or API Polling integration. If it didn't see either of those, it installed the [API Polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring) integration. If you didn't use the CLI in Step 1, you need to manually configure CloudWatch logs.

This is an optional step in [enabling New Relic's AWS Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-aws-lambda-monitoring). In [Step 1](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/account-linking), if you used the `newrelic-lambda` CLI, that automatically installs an AWS CloudWatch logs collector by default. If you didn't use that in Step 1, you can [configure CloudWatch logs yourself](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/aws-lambda-sending-cloudwatch-logs).
