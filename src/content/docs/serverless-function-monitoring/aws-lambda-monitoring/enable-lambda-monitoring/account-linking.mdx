metaDescription: Linking your AWS account with New Relic for Lambda Monitoring
---

When you link your AWS account to New Relic, you're granting permission to New Relic to create an inventory of your AWS account, and gather CloudWatch metrics for your Lambda functions. Resources in your AWS account then show up as entities in the [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts), decorated with config information.

In this integration step, we'll also store your New Relic License Key in the AWS Secrets Manager service, so that we
can send your telemetry to your New Relic account.

## Recommended Method: The `newrelic-lambda` CLI

### What do you need [#requirements]

To enable serverless monitoring using our Lambda layer, you need the following:

* [AWS CLI v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed and configured using `aws configure`.
* Python version 3.3 or higher installed.
* [newrelic-lambda CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli#installation), which you can install by running `pip install newrelic-lambda-cli`.
* A New Relic account. You must be an admin, or have the **Infrastructure manager** [add-on role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model#add-on).
* A [user key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key).
* An AWS account with permissions for creating IAM resources, managed secrets, and Lambdas. You also need permissions for creating CloudFormation stacks and S3 buckets.

Note that you may need to use `pip3` instead of `pip` if your system uses Python 2 by default.

### Using the CLI to integrate

When all the [requirements](#requirements) are in place, link your AWS account with your New Relic account by running the following command using your [user key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key) (replace all the <var>highlighted</var> values):

```
newrelic-lambda integrations install --nr-account-id <var><a href="/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/account-id">YOUR_NR_ACCOUNT_ID</a></var> \
    --linked-account-name <var>YOUR_LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME</var> \
    --nr-api-key <var><a href="https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key">YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY</a></var>
```

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI adds your New Relic license key as a secret in [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.
com/secrets-manager/) for greater security. The `--linked-account-name` parameter is to name the integration that
will appear under in New Relic's Infrastructure UI.

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Storing the New Relic license key in the AWS Secrets Manager**

  Your [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key) identifies and authenticates you to New Relic, allowing us to associate your telemetry with your New Relic account. Each function that sends telemetry needs access to this value, and it needs to be managed securely. The AWS Secrets Manager solves these problems.

  If your organization prevents you from using AWS Secrets Manager, see below for an alternative method to set your license key.

### The Infrastructure UI

The CLI is the least complicated way to link your accounts. If you need more control, however, you can go through
the [linking process](docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-new-relic-infrastructure-monitoring)
manually. Be sure to enable Lambda when selecting services to be monitored.

Don't forget to configure the License Key Secret manually, as described next.

### Manually Configuring the License Key Secret

In addition to linking your accounts, you'll need to configure the license key secret.

1. Download this CloudFormation Template: [license-key-secret.yaml](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-lambda-cli/blob/master/newrelic_lambda_cli/templates/license-key-secret.yaml)
2. Using the AWS CLI, or the AWS CloudFormation Console, install the template, supplying the `LicenseKey` parameter.
You can find your New Relic License Key [here](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher). It
will be labeled "INGEST - LICENSE". Be sure to use the license key for the account you configured with the
Infrastructure UI above.

AWS CLI example:

Be sure to replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with the license key you found above.

```
    aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name NewRelicLicenseKeySecret \
      --template-body file://license-key-secret.yaml \
      --parameters 'ParameterKey=LicenseKey,ParameterValue=<var>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Use AWS Secrets Manager [#cannot-use-secrets]

If your organization does not allow the use of AWS Secrets Manager, the New Relic Lambda Extension will accept a `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable. Add the `--disable-license-key-secret` flag from the `newrelic-lambda integrations install` command. Then set this environment variable to your [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/new-relic-license-key) in your Lambda function configuration.

### Multiple AWS regions and accounts [#multiple-regions-accounts]

The `newrelic-lambda` CLI should be run once per region, with the `--aws-region` parameter. Use the same linked account name, and the tool will detect that the account link has been created already. The license key secret needs to be created in each region.

Similarly, several AWS accounts can be linked to a New Relic account. Give each account a different linked account name. The `--aws-profile` argument to the CLI tool will select the named profile. The tool uses the same configuration as the AWS CLI.

### Failure to retrieve license key `AccessDeniedException` [#fail-retrieve-license]

Your lambda code requires the execution role which has permission to read AWS Secrets Manager. If you find a log like the following, add the appropriate permission to the policy of the execution role. In our examples, check out the `template.yaml` file to see an easy way to grant this permission.

```
Failed to retrieve license key AccessDeniedException: User: <ARN> is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: <ARN>
```
