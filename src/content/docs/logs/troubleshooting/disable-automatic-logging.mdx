This troubleshooting procedure applies to agents using [APM logs in context](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context) as of April 2022, including:

* Java [v7.6.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/)
* .NET [v9.7.0.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes/)
* Ruby [v8.6.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/)

## Problem

By default, New Relic automatically forwards agent log data with APM logs in context. You want to disable this at the account level; for example, when this automatic functionality:

* Breaks your security or compliance expectations.
* Increases your bill too much.
* Increases your systems' overhead to an unacceptable degree.

Automatic logs collection is not applicable if your agent has [high security mode](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode/) enabled.

## Solution

You can disable automatic log forwarding for **all** APM agents on your account so that no logs will be forwarded. Use the New Relic UI or NerdGraph, our GraphQL Explorer.

**Disable via UI**

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, then go to the **Data management hub**.
2. Toggle to enable or disable automatic logging.

**Disable via API**

Use the `??` mutator under `??`. **Reviewer: What do they do via NerdGraph??** Refer to the populated example in GraphiQL as well as the related documentation [in **api.newrelic.com/graphiql**](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

**Disable for some agents**

If you want to disable automatic log forwarding for some agents and enable it for other agents, you can adjust each agent's configuration settings. For more information, see the  procedures for the specific agent:

* [Java](/docs/logs/logs-context/java-configure-logs-context-all#2-decorate)
* [.NET](/docs/logs/logs-context/net-configure-logs-context-all#2-decorate)
* [Ruby](/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby#2-decorate)
