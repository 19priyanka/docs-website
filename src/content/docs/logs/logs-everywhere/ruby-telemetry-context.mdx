title: 'Ruby telemetry in context'
metaDescription: For apps monitored by the Ruby agent, learn how to link log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform.

**REVIEWER: My biggest concern is that I'm throwing way too many words into this doc. I can't decide if it's a good idea to focus on saying why this matters, or does it go too far? Would a better approach be to emphasize how simple it is? For example, if it really is just 1-update to the latest agent, and 2-do any optional config you want to do, maybe we can have one doc for all the agents? Please feel free to comment or edit directly in my PR. Thanks!**

[Telemetry in context](https://docswebsitedevelop-doc7761logsintro.gtsb.io/docs/logs/logs-everywhere/telemetry-in-context/) for the Ruby agent connects your logs with all of your telemetry data for your apps, hosts, and other entities. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly:

* Cut through the noise of thousands of logs when troubleshooting time-critical issues, so you automatically see only the most relevant logs.
* Navigate within multiple types of telemetry data, and have the data correlate back to the original issue.
* Easily drill down into more detailed information from the same place in the UI.
* Find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

For example, with telemetry in context, you can easily see [log patterns](/docs/logs/ui-data/find-unusual-logs-log-patterns), or show [surrounding logs](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/find-issues-cause-or-impact-surrounding-logs) at the time an error occurred in your app.

## Get started [#enable]

To enable telemetry in context for APM apps monitored by Ruby, install or update to [Ruby agent version 8.6.0  or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes). **REVIEWER: version tbd**

That's it! To make the most of your logging data:

* Explore the logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).
* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).

**REVIEWER: These bullets come from the original Ruby logs in context doc. Will need to be updated.**

## Optional configuration [#config]

When you update to telemetry in context, three changes are made to your configuration file:

* Application log forwarding enabled by default
* Maximum log sample stored (10,000 lines by default)
* Logging metrics, including `trace.id`, `span.id`, `entity_guid`, and `hostname`

To collect other metadata, or to change these default settings, update your [`newrelic.yml` configuration file](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/).

**REVIEWER: Does anything else in the [original Ruby logs in context doc](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby) need to be added to this?**
