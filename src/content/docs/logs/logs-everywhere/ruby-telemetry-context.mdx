metaDescription: For apps monitored by the Ruby agent, learn how to link log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform.

[Telemetry in context](https://docswebsitedevelop-doc7761logsintro.gtsb.io/docs/logs/logs-everywhere/telemetry-in-context/) for the Ruby agent connects your logs with all of your telemetry data for your apps, hosts, and other entities. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly:

* Cut through the noise of thousands of logs when troubleshooting time-critical issues, so you automatically see only the most relevant logs.
* Navigate within multiple types of telemetry data, and have the data correlate back to the original issue.
* Easily drill down into more detailed information from the same place in the UI.
* Find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

For example, with telemetry in context, you can easily see [log patterns](/docs/logs/ui-data/find-unusual-logs-log-patterns), or show [surrounding logs](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/find-issues-cause-or-impact-surrounding-logs) at the time an error occurred in your app.

## Get started [#enable]

To enable telemetry in context for APM apps monitored by Ruby, all you need to do is install or update to [Ruby agent version 8.6.0  or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes). **REVIEWER: version tbd**

When you update to telemetry in context, two changes are made to your configuration file:

* Application log forwarding enabled by default
* Maximum log sample stored (10,000 lines per minute by default)

**REVIEWER: We can link to actual config values in the Ruby doc when available.**

In addition, log decoration by default now includes `trace.id`, `span.id`, `entity.guid`, and `hostname`.

To collect other metadata, or to change these default settings, update your [`newrelic.yml` configuration file](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/).

**REVIEWER: Anything to add about what to do if they don't see telemetry data? The original Ruby logs in context doc has a troubleshooting section. https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby#troubleshooting**

## Explore your data [#view-ui]

To make the most of your logging data:

**REVIEWER: These bullets come from the original Ruby logs in context doc. Will need to be updated.**

* See your logs in context of your app's performance in the [APM UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links). Troubleshoot [errors](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/error-analytics/errors-page-find-fix-verify-problems/) with [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-data), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our [infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/). Review your [infrastructure logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#links) in the UI.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
* Explore more logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/).


**REVIEWER: Does anything else in the [original Ruby logs in context doc](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby) need to be added to this? For example, saying something along the lines that those other options are still available if you cannot update to the current agent, but you won't enjoy all the rich telemetry data. Let's chat about how to word this, because really, the goal is to encourage customers to use the latest version.**
