metaDescription: For apps monitored by the Ruby agent, learn how to link log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform.

[Telemetry in context](https://docswebsitedevelop-doc7761logsintro.gtsb.io/docs/logs/logs-everywhere/telemetry-in-context/) for the Ruby agent connects your logs with all of your telemetry data for your apps, hosts, and other entities. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly:

* Cut through the noise of thousands of logs when troubleshooting time-critical issues, so you automatically see only the most relevant logs.
* Navigate within multiple types of telemetry data, and have the data correlate back to the original issue.
* Easily drill down into more detailed information from the same place in the UI.
* Find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem.

## Enable and configure [#enable]

You have three options to configure telemetry in context for your application:

<CollapserGroup>

  <Collapser
    id="1-agent"
    title="Option 1 (simplest): Let the agent forward your logs."
  >

  This is the simplest approach, and it's a great choice for developers who may not have the access or interest in setting up a log forwarder, or for accounts that want to see the power of logs in context without a lot of overhead. 

  All you need to do is install a version of a language agent with log forwarding abilities ([Ruby agent x.x.x or higher](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/)), and update your configuration to enable forwarding.

  newrelic.yml:
  ```
  application_logging.forwarding.enabled: true
  ```

  Environment variable:
  ```
  NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_ENABLED=true
  ```

  This option may be on by default in a future agent version.

  **Optional adjustments:**

  Once this is enabled, you also have control over the maximum number of logs sent to New Relic every minute. The default value is 10,000. If more than 10,000 logs are received in a 60-second window, your logs will begin to be sampled.
  
  Set it to a higher number to receive more logs. Set it to a lower number to receive fewer logs. Any integer is valid.

  newrelic.yml:
  ```
  application_logging.forwarding.max_samples_stored: 10_000
  ```

  Environment variable:
  ```
  NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_FORWARDING_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED: 10000
  ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="2-decorate"
    title="Option 2: Let the agent decorate your logs."
  >

  Already have a log forwarder you like? We've got you covered. Language agents can decorate your logs with the linking metadata needed to provide access to telemetry-in-context features.
  
  Simply enable log decorating in your configuration, and relaunch the agent to start decorating your logs.
  
  newrelic.yml:
  ```
  application_logging.local_decorating.enabled: true
  ```

  Environment variable:
  ```
  NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_LOGGING_LOCAL_DECORATING_ENABLED=true
  ```
  
  Decoration is made possible by the addition of four attributes: `entity.guid`, `hostname`, `span.id, and `trace.id`.

  We recommend this option over the old decorating formatter, `NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter`.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="3-old-formatter"
    title="Option 3: Use the old decorating formatter."
  >

  Before language agents had the ability to forward and decorate logs, you could be enable logs in context by updating your application to use the `NewRelic::Agent::Logging::DecoratingFormatter` to send linking metadata.

  This option is still supported, but is no longer encouraged. For instructions to use this approach, see [Ruby: Configure logs in context](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby/).

  ![Use infrastructure agent as log forwarder](./images/infra-log-forwarder.png "Use infrastructure agent as log forwarder")

  If you don't have any log forwarder enabled, the UI will prompt you to use the infrastructure agent as your log forwarder.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Secure your data [#obfuscation]

Your logs may include sensitive information protected by HIPAA or other compliance protocols. By default we obfuscate number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers, but you may need to hash or mask additional information.

For more information, see our documentation about [obfuscation expressions and rules](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/ui-data/obfuscation-ui/). You can hash or mask your log data by using the New Relic UI or by using NerdGraph, our GraphQL API.

## Explore your data [#view-ui]

To make the most of your logging data:

* On the [APM **Summary** page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data), click your **Web transaction time** chart to view logs associated with a specific point in time.
* Check your app's [**Errors inbox**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to view the logs associated with your errors.
* Use [distributed tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui) to see the logs associated with individual traces.
* Set up [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/).
* [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/get-started/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) and [create dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/).
* Explore more logging data across your platform with our [Logs UI](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/). For example, with telemetry in context, you can easily see [log patterns](/docs/logs/ui-data/find-unusual-logs-log-patterns), or show [surrounding logs](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/find-issues-cause-or-impact-surrounding-logs) at the time an error occurred in your app.

## Troubleshooting tips [#troubleshooting]

Typically your logs will start to appear in less than a minute after you enable telemetry in context. If you don't see any logs for errors or traces, there may not be any for your app. Try refreshing the UI page, or change the [selected time period](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features/#data-analysis).
