The Azure Resources Manager (ARM) template provided by New Relic One helps you to:

* Set up Azure to forward logs from EventHub to New Relic One - [Send logs from Azure resources](#application-logs)
* Set up Azure Activity Logs forwarding to New Relic One through EventHub - [Azure Activity Logs](#activity-logs)

The setup process is almost the same for both use cases, but take a look at step 9 if you want to forward [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) to New Relic.

On the other hand, the template is idempotent. You can start forwarding logs from EventHub and then re-run the same template to configure [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) forwarding by completing step 9 listed below.

## Requirements [#requirements]

- A New Relic [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).

## Use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template [#using-the-template]

1. Login to [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) and click **Add more data sources** on the top right of the page.
2. Under **Log ingestion**, click on the ![Add more data sources button](./images/azure-tile.png) tile.
3. Select the account you want to send the logs from the selector, and click **Continue**.
4. Click **Generate API Key** and copy the generated **API Key**.
5. Click **Deploy to Azure** and a new tab will be open with the ARM template loaded in Azure.
6. Select the **Resource Group** in which you want to create the necessary resources, and a **Region**.
7. In the **New Relic License Key** field, paste the previously copied **API Key**.
8. Ensure the New Relic One endpoint set is the one corresponding to your account.
9. Optionally, set to true the [Azure Activity Logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log) you want to forward from the following list:
    * Administrative Azure Activity Logs
    * Alert Azure Activity Logs
    * Autoscale Azure Activity Logs
    * Policy Azure Activity Logs
    * Recommendation Azure Activity Logs
    * Resource Health Azure Activity Logs
    * Security Azure Activity Logs
    * Service Health Azure Activity Logs
10. Click **Review + create**, review the data you've inserted, and click **Create**.

## View log data [#find-data]

Once logs are streaming you can view them using:

* [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) - Search for `plugin.type:"azure"` if you have more logs sources and want to check only the ones coming from Azure.
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can run a query like:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If you want to only query for logs coming from Azure, run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM Log where plugin.type='azure'
```

## Send logs from Azure resources [#application-logs]

By default, this template only configures the needed function and resources to forward logs to New Relic, and it also configures
the activity logs to be forwarded if we set that to true when installing the template, but there isn't a default log forwarding
from your Azure resources. If you want to forward logs from any resource that produces them, you need to configure it creating
a diagnostic setting for the given resource.

As an example, if you have a function running on Azure and you want to forward the logs to New Relic you'll need to configure
a diagnostic setting for it in order to forward the logs to the configure EventHub. You can found more information about how to
do it on the [Create diagnostic settings to send platform logs and metrics to different destinations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/diagnostic-settings?tabs=CMD)

## Azure Activity Logs [#activity-logs]

Activate the Azure Activity Logs forwarding is an optional step but will give more visibility about what's happening to
your company Azure resources.

Those logs contain all the activity of the Azure resources and give information about the action that has been done
or the event that has been occurred along with the moment in which it happened, who did the change if applicable,
and other interesting data.

This allows your company to have more control over the resources, be aware of wrong or unintentional changes on
your resources and even unexpected actions. You can read more about this kind of event on the
[Azure Activity Log event schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log-schema) docs page.

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled **Logs**, you can:

* Take a look at how the New Relic One ARM template and Azure function works in the [newrelic-azure-functions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions) repository.
* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
