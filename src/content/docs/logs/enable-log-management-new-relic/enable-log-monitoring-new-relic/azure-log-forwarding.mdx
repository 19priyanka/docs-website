The Azure Resources Manager (ARM) template provided by New Relic One helps you to:

1. Setup Azure to forward logs from EventHub to New Relic One.
2. Setup Azure Activity Logs forwarding to New Relic One through EventHub.

The setup process is almost the same except for both use cases but take a look to step 11 if you want to forward Azure Activity Logs to New Relic.

On the other hand, the template is idempotent. You can start forwarding logs from EventHub and then re-run the same template to configure Azure Activity Logs forwarding by completing step 11 listed below.

## Requirements [#requirements]

- A New Relic [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).

## Use the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template [#using-the-template]

1. Login to [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) and click **Add more data sources** on the top right of the page.
2. Under **Log ingestion**, click on the ![Add more data sources button](./images/azure-tile.png) tile.
3. Select the account you want to send the logs from the selector, and click **Continue**.
4. Click **Generate API Key** and copy the generated **API Key**.
6. Click **Deploy to Azure** and a new tab will be open with the ARM template loaded in Azure.
7. Select the **Resource Group** in which you want to create the necessary resources, and a **Region**.
9. In the **New Relic License Key** field, paste the previously copied **API Key**.
10. Ensure the New Relic One endpoint set is the one corresponding to your account.
11. Optionally, set to true the activity logs you want to forward from the following list:
  - Administrative Azure Activity Logs
  - Alert Azure Activity Logs
  - Autoscale Azure Activity Logs
  - Policy Azure Activity Logs
  - Recommendation Azure Activity Logs
  - Resource Health Azure Activity Logs
  - Security Azure Activity Logs
  - Service Health Azure Activity Logs
12. Click **Review + create**, review the data you've inserted, and click **Create**.

## View log data [#find-data]

Once logs are streaming you can view them using:

* [New Relic Logs](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher) - Search for `plugin.type:"azure"` if you have more logs sources and want to check only the ones coming from Azure.
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can run a query like:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If you want to only query for logs coming from Azure, run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM Log where plugin.type='azure'
```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled **Logs**, you can:

* Take a look at how the New Relic One ARM template and Azure function works in the [newrelic-azure-functions](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-azure-functions) repository.
* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
