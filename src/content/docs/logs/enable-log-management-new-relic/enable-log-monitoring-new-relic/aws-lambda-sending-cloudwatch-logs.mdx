You can send your [CloudWatch logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) to New Relic using our AWS Lambda function, `newrelic-log-ingestion`, which can be easily deployed from the AWS Serverless application repository.

## Requirements [#compatibility-requirements]

To use our CloudWatch logs Lambda function, you only need a [New Relic license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key).

## Install the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function [#install-function]

To install the Cloudwatch logs Lambda function:

1. Open the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications "Link opens in a new window.") in your browser.
2. Search for `newrelic` and check **Show apps that create custom IAM roles or resource policies** to find `newrelic-log-ingestion`.
3. Open the `newrelic-log-ingestion` details and click **Deploy**.
4. Scroll to the **Application settings** and enter your [configure your Lambda function](#configure-function).
5. Acknowledge that the app creates custom IAM roles and then click **Deploy**.

## Configure your Lambda function [#configure-function]

You can configure logs forwarding using the following environment variables:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Key
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>

      <th>
        Value
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `LICENSE_KEY`
      </td>

      <td>
        [New Relic License key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key), needed for sending data to New Relic Infrastructure and Logs. If set, it enables forwarding to New Relic Infrastructure by default. **Required**.
      </td>

      <td>
        Your New Relic license key.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `LOGGING_ENABLED`
      </td>

      <td>
        Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic. **Required**.
      </td>

      <td>
        Default: `false`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `INFRA_ENABLED`
      </td>

      <td>
        Determines if logs are forwarded to New Relic Infrastructure. **Required**.
      </td>

      <td>
        Default: `false`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NR_LOGGING_ENDPOINT`
      </td>

      <td>
        New Relic ingestion endpoint for Logs. **Optional**.
      </td>

      <td>
        US: `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`  
        EU: `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NR_INFRA_ENDPOINT`
      </td>

      <td>
        New Relic ingestion endpoint for Infrastructure. **Optional**.
      </td>

      <td>
        `https://cloud-collector.newrelic.com`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NR_TAGS`
      </td>

      <td>
        Specify tags to be added to all log events. **Optional.**
      </td>

      <td>
        Key and value are colon delimited. Multiple key-value pairs are semi-colon delimited. E.g. `env:prod;team:myTeam`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

* Once you have updated the `function.py` and added the environment variables, click **Save**. Once complete, [link your Lambda function](#create-trigger) to CloudWatch Logs.

## Create a Lambda trigger [#create-trigger]

To get your logs streaming to New Relic you will need to attach a trigger to the Lambda:

1. From the left side menu, select **Functions**.
2. Find and select the previously created `newrelic-log-ingestion` function.
3. Under **Designer**, click **Add Triggers**, and select **Cloudwatch Logs** from the dropdown.
4. Select the the appropriate **Log group** for your application.
5. Enter a name for your filter.
6. Optional: Enter a [filter pattern](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).
7. Check the **Enable trigger** checkbox, then click **Add** to create the trigger.

## Configure retries (optional) [#config-retries]

You can configure the number of retries you want to perform in case the function fails to send the data in case of communication issues. Recommended number is 3 retries, but you can change the retry behavior by changing the below parameters:

<Callout variant="tip">
  Be aware that more number of retries can make the function run for longer time and therefore increases the probability of having higher costs for Lambda. On the contrary, decreasing the number of retries could increase the probability of data loss.
</Callout>

```
MAX_RETRIES = 3  # Defines the number of retries after lambda failure to deliver data
INITIAL_BACKOFF = 1  # Defines the initial wait seconds until next retry is executed
BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2  # Time multiplier between the retries
As an example, in default above configuration, first retry will happen after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds and third retry will happen after 4 seconds.
```

## Resources created by the SAM template [#sam-resources]

There are few resources that will be created when you create the application from the repository:

* The Lambda function itself
* A Role used to give execution permissions to the Lambda function based in CloudWatch Logs.

All other lambda configurations not listed in the steps above can be left as the defaults.

## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see data logs in both of these places:

* [New Relic Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* New Relic tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql). For example, you can execute a query like this:

  ```
  SELECT * FROM Log
  ```

## What's next? [#what-next]

Now that you've enabled Logs, here are some potential next steps:

* Explore your data using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui).
* [Configure your agent](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-apm-agents) to see contextual log data, such as [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), stack traces, application logs, and more.
* [Query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) and [create custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) or [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy).

If no data appears after you enable log management, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-logs).
