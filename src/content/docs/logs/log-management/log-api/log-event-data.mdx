metaDescription: A summary of log data storage in New Relic.
---

Log events are records stored like any other event sent to New Relic. At a minimum the record must include:

* `timestamp`
* At least one attribute containing data

Typically logs have a `message` field and level or severity, but we do not have fixed requirements for what you can send to New Relic.

## Data storage [#events]

Log records are stored by default in the `Log` event type. You can create additional event types by defining a custom data partition in Logs. The resulting types will always be prefaced with `Log_`. For detailed information, see our [data partitions documentation](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/).

**Attributes:**

* Maximum attributes: 255
* Name: maximum 255 characters
* Searchable storage: First 4096 characters

**Blob storage:**

* Maximum data per blob: 128KB
* Not searchable, but you can [query and view](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/long-logs-blobs.mdx) in the Logs UI

## Restrictions [#attributes]

Some specific attributes have additional restrictions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        Attribute
      </th>

      <th>
        Restrictions
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `accountId`
      </td>

      <td>
      This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `entity.guid`
        `entity.name`
        `entity.type`
      </td>

      <td>
        These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities.

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `appId`
      </td>

      <td>
        Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `eventType`
      </td>

      <td>
        Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, `_` underscores, and `:` colons.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `timestamp`
      </td>

      <td>
        Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds.
        
        Payloads with timestamps older than 48 hours may be dropped.
      </td>
    </tr>
