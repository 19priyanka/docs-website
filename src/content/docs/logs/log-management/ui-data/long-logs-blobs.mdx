metaDescription: How to find extensive log data stored in blobs in New Relic.
---

Extensive log data can help you troubleshoot issues. But what if an attribute in your log contains thousands of bytes? How much of this data can New Relic store? And how can you find useful information in all this data? 

## How blobs work [#blob-example]

We store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute (not just the `message` attribute) in your log record. Then, if the attribute is over 128,000 bytes, we truncate the string to get it under the limit, and store the raminder with the placeholder `blob`.

Any fields with data stored in blobs include the placeholder string `blob`. For example, in blob storage, a `message` becomes:

```
message: <first 4094 characters>
newrelic.ext.message: <rest of the characters>
```

The actual stored string length can vary. For example, if it is encoded using Base64, then we store less than 128,000 to accommodate those characters. (Characters in UTF-8 are represented by one to four bytes.)

You can search the first 4094 bytes of data for the attribute. 

## View expanded blob data in UI [#view-blob]

To query for any log data in New Relic, run the following query:

```
SELECT * FROM Log
```

To expand the blob data, run the following query, using `message` or any other attribute. Be sure to enclose the blob's attribute with backticks. For example:

```
SELECT message, <var>another-attribute</var>, blob(`newrelic.ext.message`), blob(`newrelic.ext.<var>another-attribute</var>) FROM Log
```

This expands the data in the blob so you can see (but not search) it. For example, New Relic returns:

```
{
  "message": <first 4094 characters>
  "newrelic.ext.message": <rest of the characters> 
  "another-attribute": <first 4094 characters>
  "newrelic.ext.another-attribute": <rest of the characters>
}
