[New Relic log management](/docs/introduction-new-relic-logs) enables you to quickly search through your log data in seconds. Here we explain the query syntax and how to use it, including:

* [Understanding query structure](#query-structure)
* [Searching with text](#query-text)
* [Searching by attribute](#query-attributes)

## Understand query structure [#query-structure]

Using the [Logs UI](/docs/explore-your-data-new-relic-logs-ui), you can search through your log data by entering either simple keywords, such as `new` and `relic`, or phrases such as `new relic agent` directly into the search field. You can also combine keywords or phrases with [operators](#query-operators) to form more complex queries.

  Logs queries are based on the Lucene query language. For some helpful examples, check out this [Lucene tutorial](https://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html).

### General query rules

* The query syntax is case insensitive, including queries using wildcards or operators.
* When a term contains special characters, such as `+`, `-`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `"`, `~`, `*`, `?`, `:`, `/`, or `\`, double-quote the term and escape the special characters using a backslash (`\`). Example: to query for `"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1" 202`, escape the quotes like this: `"\"POST /log/v1 HTTP/1.1\" 202"`.
* Wildcard searches can be run using an asterisk (`*`) to replace zero or more characters. Example: `new*relic`.

## Searching with text [#query-text]

Text searches can be used to join together keywords or phrases to return more specific query results.

### Text operators

The Logs query syntax accepts the following text operators:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Matching (keyword)
      </td>

      <td>
        `"new" "relic"`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results containing the keywords entered, separately.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Exact matching (phrase)
      </td>

      <td>
        `"new relic agent"`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results containing the specific phrase entered.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Either / Or
      </td>

      <td>
        `new OR relic`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results containing either or both of the keywords entered.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        And
      </td>

      <td>
        `new AND relic`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results containing both of the keywords entered.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        \* Wildcard (zero or more)
      </td>

      <td>
        `new*relic`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results containing both of the keywords entered, with zero or more characters in between.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Negation (keyword)
      </td>

      <td>
        `-new`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results that do not contain the specific keyword entered.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Negation (phrase)
      </td>

      <td>
        `-"new relic"`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results that do not contain the specific phrase entered.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Searching with attributes [#query-attributes]

Attribute searches can be used to narrow the query results to the attribute or field specified.

### General operators

The following operators can be used by all types of attributes:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Equal `:`
      </td>

      <td>
        `hostname:chi`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results where the attribute equals the keyword specified.  
        Example: The field `hostname` equals `chi`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Does not equal `- :`
      </td>

      <td>
        `-hostname:chi`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results where the attribute does not equal the keyword specified.  
        Example: The field `hostname` does not equal `chi`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Contains `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        `hostname:*chi*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results where the attribute contains the keyword specified.  
        Example: The field `hostname` contains `chi`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Does not contain `- *`
      </td>

      <td>
        `-hostname:*chi*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results where the attribute does not contain the keyword specified.  
        Example: The field `hostname` does not contain `chi`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Starts with `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        `hostname:chi*`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results where the attribute starts with the keyword specified.  
        Example: The field `hostname` starts with `chi`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Ends with `*`
      </td>

      <td>
        `hostname:*chi`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results where the attribute ends with the keyword specified.  
        Example: The field `hostname` ends with `chi`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Has
      </td>

      <td>
        `has:user_name`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results that have the specified field.  
        Example: Has the field `user_name`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Missing
      </td>

      <td>
        `missing:user_name`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results that are missing the specified field.  
        Example: Missing the field `user_name`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Numeric operators

The following operators can only be used by numeric attributes:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Condition
      </th>

      <th>
        Example
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Greater than
      </td>

      <td>
        `http_response_time_ms:>500`
      </td>

      <td>
        Searches for log results attribute matches that are greater than the given parameter.  
        Example: The field `http_response_time_ms` is greater than `500`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Greater than or equal to

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Less than or equal to
