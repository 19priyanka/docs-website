Effective January 1, 2015 New Relic supports products for a maximum of three years. "Products" include version releases of New Relic [language agents](/docs/agents/), [Infrastructure agents](/docs/infrastructure), [mobile monitoring agents](/docs/mobile-monitoring/), [SDKs](/docs/agents/agent-sdk/), [plugins](/docs/plugins/plugins-new-relic/), and other New Relic products.

## Releases after January 1, 2015

All Products released after January 1, 2015 will be supported for a maximum of three years beyond the release date. When Products reach the three-year mark, they will no longer be supported, and they may not be able to connect or report data. You will be required to upgrade to a supported version at that time.

We recommend that you [keep Products up to date](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/keeping-new-relic-date) to take advantage of the latest features and instrumentation, and to avoid reaching an end of life situation.

<Callout variant="important">
  Products may reach end of life earlier than three years for critical issues such as security patches or excessive overhead.
</Callout>

## Releases before January 1, 2015

As Products released prior to January 1, 2015 reach the three-year mark, New Relic may begin to implement this policy and discontinue support.

## End-of-life agent versions

Agent versions that are end-of-life are indicated on the [release notes](/docs/release-notes) for that agent version.
