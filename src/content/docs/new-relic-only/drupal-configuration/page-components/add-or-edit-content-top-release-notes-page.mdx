The content above a release note page is managed with [Blocks](/admin/structure/block). For example:

     <thead>
       <tr>

           Field
         </th>

         <th>
           Notes

     <tbody>
       <tr>

         </td>

         <td>

         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           Block description
         </td>

         <td>
           Provide a summary of what, why, and where the block is.
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           Block body
         </td>

         <td>
           Enter the content that will display in the specified location.
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>
           Region settings > NRKB
         </td>

         <td>
           Select the front-end page location the content should appear. For release notes page, select **Content**.
         </td>
       </tr>

       <tr>
         <td>

         </td>

         <td>
           Select **Only the listed pages** radio item and enter the path of the release note page.
         </td>
       </tr>
     </tbody>
