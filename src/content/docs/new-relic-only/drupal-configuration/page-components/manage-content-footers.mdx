  Only the Docs team can edit and create new footer blocks. If you'd like to request additions, changes, or deletions to footer content, contact `@hero` in the [#documentation](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation) Slack channel or send an email to [docs@newrelic.com](mailto:docs@newrelic.com).

Content footer blocks are standardized and customizable text that Drupal automatically places at the bottom of each document on the New Relic Docs site. This is the content under the **For more help** section header. Footer block content varies by document category, but often begins with:

In some cases, such as with hidden docs, you may need to add manual footer text. In some cases, you may want to simply recreate the standard footer block. In the past, we've also used:

```

In general, manual footer text shouldn't be used, but is sometimes necessary for hidden docs and other special cases.

## Create a new footer block [#create-footer]

When creating a new footer block, use Drupal's [taxonomy management tools](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/drupal-taxonomy/primary-navigation-taxonomy-management) to choose where that block will appear:

1. In the Drupal menu bar, click **Manage > Structure > Blocks**.
2. Click **<Icon name="fe-plus"/>
   Add block**.
3. Leave the **Block title** field blank.
4. In the **Block description** field, type a descriptive name; for example, `Java agent help footer`.
5. In the **Block body** field, type the text you want to appear in the footer block. Follow the text guidelines in the [Use generic footer block](/docs/new-relic-only/drupal-configuration/page-components/manage-content-footers#generic-footer) section.
6. In the **Region settings > NRKB (default theme)** dropdown, select `Content Bottom`. Scroll down to the Region settings > NRKB (default theme) dropdown, and select Content bottom.
7. Under **Visibility settings > Pages**, click `Only the listed pages`. Then [specify a target URL](#specify-url); for example, `docs/apm/*`. Don't use `All pages except those listed`, because it will put your content everywhere.

After you save, the new footer block takes effect immediately.

## Edit an existing footer [#edit-footer]

To edit an existing footer block:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="from-page"
    title="Edit from a page containing the footer"
  >
    1. Go to a page containing the footer you want to edit.
    2. Mouse over the footer, click the gear <Icon name="fe-settings"/>
       icon, then click **Configure block**.
    3. In the **Block body** field, edit the footer content, then save.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="from-blocks-list"
    title="Edit from the blocks table"
  >
    1. In the Drupal menu bar, click **Manage > Structure > Blocks**.
    2. In the **Content bottom** section of the table, find the footer you want to edit, and click **configure**.
    3. In the **Block body** field, edit the footer content, then save.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Choose where a footer appears [#specify-url]

Footer block content has a specific taxonomy within the site. A footer's location is set using a relative path URL defined in the Drupal **Blocks > (select a content footer) > Visibility settings > Pages** field.

* Choose a path for the super-category, category, or subcategory where the footer will be shown.
* End the path with an asterisk `*` to apply the footer to all documents in that category.
* To set the footer to multiple categories, list each path on its own line.
* To add the footer to a single doc, use its full URL.
* If you're creating a footer for a single document, instead of using a path, simply maintain that footer content directly within the page content itself.

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Content footer path**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Examples**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Super-category
      </td>

      <td>
        * URL for placement in a category: `docs/agents/*`
        * URL for placement in a single doc: `https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Category
      </td>

      <td>
        * URL for placement in a category: `docs/agents/java-agent/*`
        * URL for placement in a single doc: `https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Subcategory
      </td>

      <td>
        * URL for placement in a subcategory: `docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/*`
        * URL for placement in a single doc: `https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Hidden docs

Hidden docs exist outside of the taxonomy and won't be included in any generic or category-specific footers. If you're having trouble getting a footer set for a doc, this is one possible reason. Hidden docs must have a URL without a suoer-category, category, or sub-category, such as `docs.newrelic.com/docs/name-of-doc`. Alternately, you can check the doc, to see if it has a page location set to **None**.

For more information on hidden docs, see [Hide or restrict content](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/processes-procedures/hide-or-restrict-content) and [Checklist for public beta or GA](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/processes-procedures/checklist-public-beta-or-ga).

## Use generic footer block [#generic-footer]

Some categories and sub-categories apply to New Relic as a whole rather than a specific product or agent; for example, the main [Getting Started with New Relic](/docs/accounts-partnerships/getting-started-new-relic) sub-category.

If you create or update categories and sub-categories that don't need links to specific products or agents, add them to the existing **Generic help footer** block, which contains this text:
