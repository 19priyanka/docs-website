The RSS feed link on release note pages is managed via the [Blocks](/admin/structure/block) (HTML source, including some PHP to display current page path) and [Context](/admin/structure/context) (to specify which pages each block should display) modules. Style is mostly defined in-line for now.

Example: RSS feed link on both the Java release note term page (left) and the Java release note node page (right). Title attribute appears on hover.

## Contents [#qiklinks]

## Edit RSS link HTML [#edit-html]

The RSS feed link HTML is managed via a block. To edit the feed link:

1. Configure the appropriate block:

   - [RSS Feed: Release notes (node)](/admin/structure/block/manage/block/71/configure)
   - [RSS Feed: Release notes (term)](/admin/structure/block/manage/block/76/configure)

2. Edit the HTML in the **Block body** field.
3. Select **Save block**. Changes should be live immediately.

## Edit RSS link path context [#edit-context]

The RSS feed link context (on what pages it displays) is managed via a context. To edit the feed context:

1. Edit the appropriate context:

   - [individual_release_notes context](/admin/structure/context/list/individual_release_notes/edit) (node context)
   - [release_notes_leaf context](/admin/structure/context/list/release_notes_leaf/edit) (term context)

2. Add or edit a path in the **Conditions > Path**.
3. Select **Save**. Changes should be live immediately.
