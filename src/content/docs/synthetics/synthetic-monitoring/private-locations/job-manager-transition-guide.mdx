In early 2022, we released a [new runtime](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/new-runtime) for public locations that simplified script creation, gave scripted monitors access to Chrome 100 and Node 16, and introduced automated monitor management with our [NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial). 

The synthetic monitoring job managers bring monitors on the newest runtime to your private locations, letting your monitors use environments similar to the ones used by your customers. 

## Smaller container images for your synthetics [#docker]

Job managers deploy your synthetics from runtime-specific container images tailored to the jobs you want to deploy. While CPMs bundled legacy runtimes and artifacts into one growing file, our job manager instead separates our Chrome, Node, and job management work into separate, smaller images. In short, by upgrading your CPMs to job managers, your private location jobs will take up less memory on your host. 

With more control over job configuration for your private locations, job managers also let you: 

* Opt out of running a subset of runtime images if they are not required for their monitors.
* Update your runtime images (ping, API, and browser) independently of synthetics job manager updates.
* Ignore the ping runtime if you don't use it. It's no longer part of the base image, so you can configure and size your docker image how you want it.

## Simplified deployment with job managers [#deploy]

Unlike CPMs, which used file sharing to coordinate jobs in private locations, job managers communicate via HTTP with web services. This removes certain requirements needed to deploy jobs, such as specifying mounted volume in your docker configuration or persistent volume in your Kubernetes configuration. 

By simplifying deployment, the job manager: 

* Reduces the possibility of permissions-related errors in high security environments.
* Reduces the risk of internal engine errors by no longer creating unique docker networksfor non-ping monitor jobs.
* Gives better support at deployment for Kubernetes labels, annotations, node selectors, tolerations, and affinity across all components

## Install and configure your private locations monitors [#monitorMigration]

Ready to download the job manager? You have a few options for getting started. Check out our [install doc](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/private-locations/install-job-manager) for installation procedures, or read through our [configuration doc](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/job-manager-configuration) for working with new or existing [private locations](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations). 

Keep in mind that with both CPMs and job managers available for legacy runtimes and the newest runtime, you can configure both CPMs and the job managers with the same private location key. If you'd rather start fresh, then have the synthetics job manager deploy their own private locations. There's no functional difference between the two, and comes down to your own personal preference. 

## Upgrade your monitors [#upgrade]

The synthetics job manager is not legacy runtime compatible and CPMs are not compatible with the newest runtime. If your job managers and CPMs are sharing a key, then your CPMs will handle any monitors on the legacy runtime, while the job manager will handle any monitors on the newest runtime. In other words, CPMs cannot deploy scripted monitors that use Chrome 100 or Node 16. 

If you want to upgrade your monitors:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core), click **Synthetics**, then select the monitor you want to edit.
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **General**. 
3. Switch to the newest runtime view via the dropdown menu. For scripted API monitors, choose Node 16. For scripted browser monitors, choose Chrome 100.
4. If using separate private locations for containerized private minions and synthetics job managers, update the location selection.
5. Click **Validate** to check that your monitors function in the new runtime. Make any script modifications if needed. 
6. Save.

Decided to upgrade to the new runtime? Check out our [NerdGraph APIs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#update-monitors) to programmatically update monitors.

## Limitations [#limitations]

A few capabilities available to CPMs aren't supported by synthetics job manager. We'll include these features in the upcoming months and update this page as they become available. They include: 

* Ping monitor execution, which will be addressed shortly after release
* Support for SSL certificate expiration, broken link, and step monitors
* Verified script execution (VSE)
* Check timeout overrides
* User defined environment variables
* Adjusting JVM configuration options
