Synthetics job manager is the next generation version of the containerized private minion (CPM), providing many additional benefits and unlocking the use of our newest synthetic runtimes.

## Benefits [#benefits]

The New Relic synthetics job manager can operate in Docker or Kubernetes enviornments, with benefits including:

* Support for the latest synthetics runtimes on private locations
* Legacy runtimes and artifacts are no longer bundled, reducing image size
* A mounted volume / persistent volume and claim are no longer required, reducing permissions related errors in high security environments
* Unique Docker networks are no longer created for each non-ping monitor jobs, reducing the risk of internal engine errors
* The ping runtime is no longer part of the base image, allowing for easier configuration and sizing
* The large minion runner image has been replaced with smaller, runtime specific images
* Runtime images (ping, API, and browser) can be updated independently of synthetics job manager updates
* Customers can choose not to download or run a subset of runtime images if they are not required for their monitors
* Better support for Kubernetes labels, annotations, node selectors, tolerations, and affinity across all components

## Limitations [#limitations]

A few capabilities supported by the containerized private minion are not yet supported by synthetics job manager. Support for these less used features will be added over the coming months. We will update this page as support becomes available.

* Ping monitor execution, which will be addressed shortly after release
* Support for SSL certificate expiration, broken link, and step monitors
* Verified script execution (VSE)
* Check timeout overrides
* User defined environment variables
* Adjusting JVM configuration options

## Install and configuration [#install]

Synthetics job managers can be [installed](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/install-job-manager) and [configured](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/job-manager-configuration) using either new or existing [private locations](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations). 

## Upgrading Monitors [#monitorMigration]

Containerized private minions (CPMs) and synthetics job managers can be configured with the same private location key or you can decide to create new private locations for your synthetics job manager deployment. If containerized private minions (CPMs) and synthetics job managers are configured with the same private location key, legacy runtime monitors will be executed by CPMs and new runtime monitors will be executed by synthetic job managers. Legacy runtime monitors will not run on synthetic job managers. New runtime (Chrome 100 / Node 16) monitors will not run on containerized private minions. 

To upgrade your monitors through the UI:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core), click **Synthetics**, then select the monitor you want to edit.
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **General**. 
3. Use the dropdown menu to switch the current runtime view (use Node 16 for scripted API monitors and Chrome 100 for scripted browser monitors). 
4. If using separate private locations for containerized private minions and synthetics job managers, update the location selection.
5. Click **Validate** to check that your monitors function in the new runtime. Make any script modifications if needed. 
6. Save.

[NerdGraph APIs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial/#update-monitors) can be used to programmatically update monitors to use new runtimes.
