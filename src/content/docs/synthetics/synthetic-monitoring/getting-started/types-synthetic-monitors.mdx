You can proactively monitor your website or API endpoints with [synthetic](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics) monitors. Depending on the type of monitor, you can:

* [Add and edit monitors](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors).
* Use the [Synthetics REST API](/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/manage-synthetics-monitors-rest-api) to manage monitors.
* Set up monitors from [specific locations or for private servers](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/private-locations/private-locations-overview-monitor-internal-sites-add-new-locations).

You can also use the [host not reporting](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/configuration/create-infrastructure-host-not-reporting-condition) feature in [infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure). This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts.

## Types of monitors [#types-monitors]

These are the seven types of synthetic monitors:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Type of synthetic monitor
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Broken links monitor
      </td>

      <td>
        Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Certificate check monitor
      </td>

      <td>
        Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Ping monitor

        API name: `SIMPLE`
      </td>

      <td>
        Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site.

        For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as `Google Chrome`. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Step monitor

        API name: `STEP_MONITOR`
      </td>

      <td>
        Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. 

        The monitor can be configured to:
        - Navigate to a URL 
        - Type text
        - Click an element
        - Assert text
        - Assert an element 
        - Secure a credential
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Simple browser monitors

        API name: `BROWSER`
      </td>

      <td>
        Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome.

        Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as `Google Chrome`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Scripted browser monitors

        API name: `SCRIPT_BROWSER`
      </td>

      <td>
        Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present.

        The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of [third-party modules](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/scripted-monitor-runtime-environment#runtime-table) to build your custom monitor.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        API tests

        API name: `SCRIPT_API`
      </td>

      <td>
        API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the [`http-request` module](https://github.com/request/request "Link opens in a new window.") internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Dismiss Modal
      </td>

      <td>
        Use this step type to either accept or cancel a modal on the loaded page. Optionally, text can be entered into the modal, if there is a text box associated with the modal.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Secure Credential
      </td>

      <td>
        Use this step type to enter a secure credential value into a text box on the loaded page. Enter the locator for the element to insert the secure credential into and then select the secure credential you want into that text box. The account must contain at least one Secure Credential before a Secure Credential step can be added to a monitor.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Assert Text
      </td>

      <td>
        Use this step type to assert (assure and fail if not) that an element either is equal to, not equal to, contains, or does not contain the text you specify, or that an element contains a number that is less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, equal to, or not equal to a number you specify.
      </td>
