New Relic is releasing a new runtime version for public monitoring locations. We plan to apply the new runtime to private monitors by the end of 2022.

The new runtime addresses our Legacy runtimeâ€™s backend limitations. While backwards support will be provided for monitors using the Legacy runtime and its features, we recommend that you convert to the current runtime as soon as possible. All new monitors will default to the new runtime, but existing monitors need additional configuration.
