metaDescription: "Synthetic monitoring's new runtime requires that you make some changes to your already existing monitors."
---

Synthetic monitoring has a new runtime that affects your public monitors. By converting from the legacy runtime to the new runtime, you improve the backend environment that your public monitors execute from. New synthetic monitors default to using the new runtime. If you've created a synthetic monitor using the legacy runtime, there are extra [configuration steps](#runtime-convert).

Making the switch gives you these features:

* Access to newer versions of Google Chrome, so your scripted browser monitors run with browser versions closer to the versions used by your customers. 
* Access to the updated scripted API runtime that uses `Got` node.js library  instead of the deprecated `Request` library. 
* Support for async / await syntax. This simplifies script creation and maintenance, diverging from the old runtime’s `.then` promise chaining.
* Support for shadow DOM objects, allowing your monitors to find objects inside the shadow DOM.
* [Custom timing library](SOMETHING) for scripted API monitors.
- Access to programmatic management of your synthetic monitors using [NerdGraph APIs](SOMETHING). 

We recommend converting your legacy runtime to take advantage of these capabilities. Eventually, we plan to make this new runtime available for private monitoring locations.

Before switching, make sure that you've updated your allow lists to accept network requests from the new runtime’s [public IP ranges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/new-synthetic-public-minion-ips).

## Switching to the new runtime from the UI [#runtime-UI]

You have the option to toggle between the legacy environment and the new runtime environment when you create a new monitor. 

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core), then click **Synthetics**.
2. Click **Create monitor**, then select the public monitor type you want to create.
3. Use the **Runtime** dropdown menu to switch between the legacy and new runtime environment. 
4. Create your monitor. 

## Convert your monitors to the new runtime [#runtime-convert]

To prevent your critical monitors from breaking during future end of life processes, we recommend you convert your public monitors sooner rather than later. To convert:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core), click **Synthetics**, then select the monitor you want to edit.
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **General**. 
3. Use the dropdown menu to switch the current runtime view (use Node 16 for scripted APIs and Chrome 97 for scripted browser monitors). 
4. Validate that your monitors function, and make any script modifications as needed. 
5. Save.

## Deprecated features [#deprecated]

We’re introducing new language that changes the script syntax in your scripted browser monitors. We recommend that you update your scripts to account for language changes and prevent potential broken monitors in the future.
