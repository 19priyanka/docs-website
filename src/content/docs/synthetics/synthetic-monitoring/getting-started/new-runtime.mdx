title: Convert to the new synthetic runtimes

metaDescription: "Synthetic monitoring's new runtime requires that you make some changes to your already existing monitors."
---

We're introducing a new runtime for public monitoring locations. We plan to apply the new runtime to private monitors by the end of 2022. While we're providing backwards support for monitors using the Legacy runtime and its features, we recommend converting to the current runtime as soon as possible. 

Going forward, new monitors are defaulting to the new runtime while monitors created using the Legacy version will need additional configuration.

<Callout variant="important">
Before switching to the new runtime, confirm that you've updated your allow lists to accept network requests from the new runtime’s [public IP ranges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/new-synthetic-public-minion-ips).
</Callout>

## Benefits [#benefits]

Converting to the new runtime gives you: 

- **Access to newer versions of Google Chrome.** With planned updates twice a year, the new runtime allows us to keep Chrome up to date so your monitors use the most recent Chrome version.   
- **Access to the updated scripted API runtime.** This includes updates to newer versions of node.js. 
- **Support for async / await syntax.** This simplifies script creation and maintenance, diverging from the old runtime’s `.then` promise chaining.
- **Support for shadow DOM objects.** Updated runtime treats shadow DOM updates similar to frames, allowing your monitors to find objects inside the shadow DOM.
- **Custom timing library for scripted API monitors.** SOMETHING
- **Support for synthetics using [NerdGraph APIs](SOMETHING).** The current runtime introduces programmatic management of your synthetic monitors in NerdGraph. 

## Switching to the new runtime from the UI [#runtime-UI]

## Converting your monitors to the new runtime [#runtime-convert]

1. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click **Synthetics** > Select the monitor you want to edit.
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **General**. 
3. Toggle the dropdown menu to switch to the current runtime view, rather than Legacy view. 
  - For scripted API monitors, toggle from Node SOMETHING to Node 16. [screenshots] 
  - For scripted browser monitors, toggle from Legacy Chrome 72 to Chrome 97. [screenshots]
4. Validate that your monitors function, and make any script modifications as needed. 
5. Save.

## Deprecated features [#deprecated]

We’re introducing new syntax that changes how your scripted monitors direct your browsers. We recommend that you update your scripts to account for language changes and prevent potential broken monitors in the future.
