metaDescription: "Synthetic monitoring's new runtime requires that you make some changes to your already existing monitors."
---

New Relic is releasing a new runtime version for public monitoring locations. We plan to apply the new runtime to private monitors by the end of 2022. While backwards support will be provided for monitors that use the Legacy runtime, we recommend that you convert to the current runtime as soon as possible. 

All new monitors will default to the new runtime, but existing monitors need additional configuration.

## Benefits [#benefits]

The new runtime is the environment where your monitors are executed from. Converting to the new runtime environment provides: 

- **Access to newer versions of Google Chrome.** With planned updates twice a year, the new runtime allows us to keep Chrome up to date so your monitors use the most recent Chrome version.   
- **Access to updated scripted API runtime.** This includes updates to newer versions of node.js. 
- **Support for async / await syntax.** This simplifies script creation and maintenance, diverging from the old runtime’s `.then` promise chaining.
- **Support for shadow DOM objects.** Updated runtime treats shadow DOM updates similar to frames, allowing your monitors to find objects inside the shadow DOM.
- **Custom timing library for scripted API monitors.** Custom timing library 
- **Support for synthetic monitoring using NerdGraph APIs.** The current runtime introduces synthetic monitoring to NerdGraph, allowing you to bulk manage your monitors more programatically. 

## Switching to the new runtime from the UI [#runtime-UI]

Before switching to the new runtime, confirm that you've updated your allow lists to accept network requests from the new runtime’s [public IP ranges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/new-synthetic-public-minion-ips).

## Converting your monitors to the new runtime [#runtime-convert]

Before converting your monitors to the new runtime, confirm that you've updated your allow lists to accept network requests from the new runtime's [public IP ranges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/new-synthetic-public-minion-ips). 

1. Go to one.newrelic.com, then click **Synthetics** > Select the monitor you want to edit 
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **General**. 
3. Toggle the dropdown menu to switch to the current runtime view, rather than Legacy view. 
  - For scripted API monitors, toggle from Node 10 to Node 16. [screenshots] 
  - For scripted browser monitors, toggle from Legacy Chrome 72 to Chrome 97. [screenshots]
4. Validate that your monitors function, and make any script modifications as needed. 
5. Save.

## Deprecated features [#deprecated]

We’re introducing new syntax that changes how your scripted monitors direct your browsers. While we’re providing backwards support for deprecated syntax, we recommend that you update your scripts to avoid future disruptions caused by broken monitors.
