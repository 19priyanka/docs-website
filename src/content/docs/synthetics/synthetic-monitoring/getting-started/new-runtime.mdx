metaDescription: "Synthetic monitoring's new runtime requires that you make some changes to your already existing monitors."
---

Synthetic monitoring has a new runtime that affects your public monitors. By converting from the legacy runtime to the new runtime, you improve the backend environment that your public monitors execute from. New synthetic monitors default to using the new runtime. If you've created a synthetic monitor using the legacy runtime, there are extra [configuration steps](#runtime-convert).

Making the switch gives you these features:

* Access to newer versions of Google Chrome, so your scripted browser monitors use browser versions similar to the ones used by your customers. 
* Access to the updated scripted API runtime that uses `Got` node.js library  instead of the deprecated `Request` library. 
* Support for async / await syntax. This simplifies script creation and maintenance, diverging from the old runtime’s `.then` promise chaining.
* Better support for shadow DOM objects.
* [Custom timing library](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/custom-timing-details) for scripted API monitors.
- Access to automated management of your synthetic monitors using our [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-synthetics-tutorial). 

We recommend updating your synthetic monitors that were created using the legacy runtime to take advantage of these capabilities. We plan to release this new runtime for private monitoring locations later this year.

Before switching, make sure that you've updated your allow lists to accept network requests from the new runtime’s [public IP ranges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/new-synthetic-public-minion-ips).

## Convert your monitors to the new runtime [#runtime-convert]

Existing monitors default to the runtime you created them on. To prevent your critical monitors from breaking during future end of life processes, we recommend you convert your public monitors sooner rather than later. To convert:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core), click **Synthetics**, then select the monitor you want to edit.
2. From the **Settings** tab, click **General**. 
3. Use the dropdown menu to switch the current runtime view (use Node 16 for scripted APIs and Chrome 97 for scripted browser monitors). 
4. Click **Validate** to check that your monitors function in the new runtime. Make any script script modifications if needed. 
5. Save.

## Switch to the new runtime from the UI [#runtime-UI]

From the UI, you have the option to toggle between the two runtimes. While the new runtime is backwards compatible with the legacy runtime, we recommend that you convert to the new runtime environment as soon as possible. 

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core), then click **Synthetics**.
2. Click **Create monitor**, then select the public monitor type you want to create.
3. Use the **Runtime** dropdown menu to switch between the legacy and new runtime environment. 
4. Create your monitor. 

## Deprecated features [#deprecated]

We’re introducing new language that changes the script syntax in your scripted browser monitors. We recommend that you update your scripts to account for language changes and prevent potential broken monitors in the future.
