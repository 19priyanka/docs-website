New Relic is releasing a new runtime version for public monitoring locations. We plan to apply the new runtime to private monitors by the end of 2022.

The new runtime addresses our Legacy runtime’s backend limitations. While backwards support will be provided for monitors that use the Legacy runtime, we recommend that you convert to the current runtime as soon as possible. 

All new monitors will default to the new runtime, but existing monitors need additional configuration.

## Benefits [#benefits]

The new runtime is the environment where your monitors are executed from. Converting to the new runtime environment provides: 

- **Access to newer versions of Google Chrome.** The new runtime allows us to keep Chrome up to date with planned updates twice a year, ensuring that your monitors perform without page load failures caused by unsupported browser versions.  
- **Access to newer versions of node.js.** 
- **Support for async / await syntax.** This simplifies script creation and maintenance, diverging from the old runtime’s `.then` promise chaining.
- **Support for shadow DOM objects.** Updated runtime treats shadow DOM updates similar to frames, allowing your monitors to find objects inside the shadow DOM.
- **Custom timing library for scripted API monitors.** 
- **Programmatic management for all monitor types using NerdGraph APIs.**

## Switching to the new runtime from the UI [#runtime-UI]

Go to one.newrelic.com, then click **Synthetics** > **Create monitor** > Select public monitor type > **Runtime** > Toggle between Legacy runtime and current runtime. 

All new public monitors default to the new runtime. We recommend that you update your allow/deny lists to account for the new runtime’s [public IP ranges](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/administration/new-synthetic-public-minion-ips).
