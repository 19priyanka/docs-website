Your organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included for free per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

Included synthetics monitor checks: 

* Free tier: 500 per month
* Standard edition: 10K per month
* Pro edition: 1M per month
* Enterprise edition: 10M per month

Each time a monitor runs from one location, that counts as one check. If a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, that is 24 x 5 checks per day, which would total 120 checks. 

## Exceeding the included amount [#exceeding-limits]

For information on the cost for going above the included number of monitors, see [List price](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions).
