Your organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks can be run per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

Synthetic monitor check limits: 

* Free tier: 500 per month
* Standard edition: 10K per month
* Pro edition: 1M per month
* Enterprise edition: 10M per month

Each time a monitor runs from one location, that counts as one check. If a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, that is 24 x 5 checks per day, which would total 120 checks. 

## View Historical Consumption [#consumption]

The [NrDailyUsage event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage) is generated once per day and can be used to view synthetics consumption. [`FACET`](docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-facet) can be used to break this consumption into many categories, including account, location, monitor type, and monitor name. Run these queries in [parent or partner accounts](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/) to obtain aggregated consumption across your account structure.

Both successful and failed checks contribute to overall synthetics consumption.
