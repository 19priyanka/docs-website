Your organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks can be run per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

Synthetic monitor check limits: 

* Standard edition: 10K per month
* Pro edition: 1M per month
* Enterprise edition: 10M per month

The limit applies to all monitors combined. So, for example: each time a monitor runs from one location, that is one check. If a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, that is 24 x 5 checks per day, which would total 120 checks.
