Your organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included for free per month. These limits apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

A synthetic monitoring check is an individual execution of a synthetic monitor. When a monitor runs from one location, it counts as one check, so you can also think of synthetics check as a synthetics job, or a job execution. 

For example, if a monitor is configured to run once per hour from 5 locations, then that comes out to `24 * 5` checks per day, totaling 120 checks. Your organization's pricing edition determines your check limits and you can view and facet the number of checks that have been executed. 

## Included check counts per edition [#edition-limits]

Your organization's [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) determines how many synthetic monitor checks are included per month. These apply to all [monitor types](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/types-synthetic-monitors) except the simple ping monitor. 

The following are the synthetic monitor checks included for free with each pricing edition: 

* Free tier: 500 per month
* Standard edition: 10K per month
* Pro edition: 1M per month
* Enterprise edition: 10M per month

For information on the cost for exceeding the included number of monitors, see [List price](/docs/licenses/license-information/usage-plans/new-relic-one-usage-plan-descriptions).

## View historical synthetics usage [#consumption]

The [NrDailyUsage event](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrDailyUsage) is generated once per day and can help you understand synthetics usage.

By using [`FACET`](docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-facet), you can break your consumption into multiple categories, including account, location, monitor type, and monitor name. If you have a [parent account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/parent-child-account-structure/), ensure you run queries in a parent account to see the aggregated usage for that parent and its child accounts.

Both successful and failed checks contribute to overall synthetics consumption. Below are sample queries to view and facet your synthetics consumption:
