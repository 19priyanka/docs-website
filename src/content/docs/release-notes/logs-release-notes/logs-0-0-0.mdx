Questions: 
1. What does "downloadLink: 'something'" do? Will need to add to front matter if applicable.
2. How to add the RSS feed to a new category?
3. On release notes landing page, it looks like other logos come from `@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic`. But a Logs logo does not already exist there, so how can I get one added? (Skyler H., logs UI designer, is aware of this conversation. Currently there's no real Logs logo in UI so we may need to get one designed and add it later.)
4. Is there a yml file somewhere so that the release notes category knows there's a new Logs sub-category here? I don't see anything for release notes in the /nav yml list.
5. In the /templates folder, is there anything I need to do to rleaseNote.js or releaseNoteLandingPage.js?
6. Will need to change release date and version info from Logs PMs.
