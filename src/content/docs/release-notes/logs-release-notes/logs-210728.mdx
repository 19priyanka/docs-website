This is our first changelog for New Relic's logs capabilities, so we won't even try to list everything we've done since it initially launched in 2019. This summarizes a few of the most recent fixes and enhancements.

We've been listening to you, and we're working hard to give you the logs experience yet. To stay up to date, subscribe to our [Logs RSS feed](). More to come soon!

### New public APIs

* In addition to the Logs UI for [data partition management](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/), you can use our public API. Data partitions help you query more efficiently by scanning less unrelated data and returning results faster. To get started, see our [NerdGraph tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-data-partition-rules-tutorial/). 
* [Parsing rules](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api/) are also publicly accessible via API. We already provide built-in parsing rulesets](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/built-log-parsing-rulesets/) to facet or filter logs in useful ways. This in turn helps you build better charts and alerts.
* If you can't use log forwarders because of situtions such as CDNs, hardware devices, or managed services, you can use syslog protocols via a [TCP endpoint](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/use-tcp-endpoint-forward-logs-new-relic/).

### Bug fixes

* Fixed link to see logs from the [Fluentd forwarder](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/fluentd-plugin-log-forwarding/).
* Fixed crash when browsing after using a [saved view](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/use-logs-ui/#saved-views).
* Fixed scenario where [logs in context for distributed tracing](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/configure-logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/) wouldn't work.

### Changes

* Because of intermittent Fluent Bit build failures, SUSE will no longer be a supported platform for the [infrastructure monitoring agent's log forwarder](). We are working on adding SUSE support in the next six months.
