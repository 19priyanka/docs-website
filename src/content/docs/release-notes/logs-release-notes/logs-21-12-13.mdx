### Bug fixes

The log forwarding functionality from [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](/docs/logs/forward-logs/stream-logs-using-kinesis-data-firehose) was prepending the `message` and `timestamp` attributes with `logEvent`. For example, you might see `logEvent.message` and `logEvent.timestamp` in the UI. This prevented default JSON parsing and also applied the ingestion time rather than the timestamp in the logs. This bug has been fixed.
