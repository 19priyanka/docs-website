## Notes

This release of the Python agent updates the log file location in the default newrelic.ini file and includes multiple bug fixes.

The agent can be installed using easy_install/pip/distribute via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or can be downloaded directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).



## Improved Features

* **Updated log_file location in default newrelic.ini**

  The newrelic.ini generated using newrelic-admin generate-config has been updated to set the default log_file location to stdout for improved initial visibility. This setting can still be customized to log to a user-specified fie or stderr as well.



## Bug Fixes

* **Handling of CherryPy HTTPRedirects**

  cherrypy.HttpRedirects were incorrectly being reported as errors. This has now been corrected thanks to contribution from [@bdeeney](https://github.com/bdeeney)!

* **Invalid escape sequence DeprecationWarning**

  A deprecation warning concerning unrecognized escape sequences in Python 3.6+ has been fixed. Thank you [@urianchang](https://github.com/urianchang) for your contribution!
