## Notes

This release of the Python agent enables Distributed Tracing by default, deprecates Cross Application Tracing, and includes bug fixes.

Install the agent using `easy_install/pip/distribute` via the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic) or download it directly from the New Relic [download site](http://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).

## New Features

* **Reservoir sizes now configurable using settings and environment variables**

  Reservoir sizes for span events, transaction events, error events, and custom events are now configurable via environment variables. These reservoirs limit both the maximum number of events that can be sent as well as local memory usage.

  Additionally, the default span reservoir size has been increased from 1000 to 2000. If your agent begins sending more data than previously, you can opt to reduce `event_harvest_config.harvest_limits.span_event_data` to 1000 to restore previous rates.

  These settings previously existed via config file but were undocumented. For details, see the new [documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#event-harvest-config).

## Deprecations

* **Cross Application is now deprecated, and disabled by default**

  Distributed tracing is replacing cross application tracing as the default means of tracing between services. Cross application tracing will soon be removed entirely with a future release.
  
  To continue using it temporarily while transitioning to distributed tracing, enable it with `cross_application_tracer.enabled = True` and `distributed_tracing.enabled = False`.

## Changes

* **Distributed tracing is enabled by default**

  The default setting for `distributed_tracing.enabled` is now True and the default setting for `cross_application_tracer.enabled` is now False.
