## New Relic PHP Agent v10.3.0.0

### Important End Of Life Information
* Support for 32 bit and FreeBSD binaries were deprecated with release v9.19.0.309 and **are no longer shipped starting with this release**.
* Support for ZTS binaries was deprecated with release v9.17.0.300 and will be **removed in a release in the near future**.
* **It is essential any installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform (32 bit, FreeBSD, ZTS, etc) DISABLE auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent.**  Alternately pinning the PHP agent to version that is known to have support for the now unsupported feature(s) would achieve the same effect.  Failure to do so could result in a newer release (without support for the system) being installed and lead to the disruption of the collection of APM data.
* The (PHP agent compatibility and requirements)[https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements/] page should be consulted for the latest information on supported PHP versions and platforms.

### New Features
* APM logs in context. Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This version of the agent will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic. To learn more about this feature see [PHP: Configure logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php), and additional configuration options are available [PHP agent configuration: Config file](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#logs-in-context). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account see [Disable automatic logging](/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging).

### Bug Fixes
* agent: Fix to ensure datastore segments do not create children segments. [#511](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-php-agent/pull/511)



### Support statement
* New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. For more information on supported agent versions and EOL timelines, check out our [PHP EOL policy](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-eol-policy/).
