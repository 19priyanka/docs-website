### APM logs in context
Automatic application log forwarding is now enabled by default. This version of the agent will automatically send enriched application logs to New Relic. To learn more about about this feature see [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/get-started-logs-context/), and additional configuration options are available [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/net-configure-logs-context-all). To learn about how to toggle log ingestion on or off by account see [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/logs-context/disable-automatic-logging).
