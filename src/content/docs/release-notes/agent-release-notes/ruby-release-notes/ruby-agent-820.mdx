  ## v8.2.0

  * **New Instrumentation for Tilt gem**

    Template rendering using [Tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt) is now instrumented. Versions 2.x are supported for Ruby versions 2.2 and above. Versions 1.x are supported for Ruby versions below 2.7. See [PR #847](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/pull/847) for details.

  * **Configuration `error_collector.ignore_errors` is marked as deprecated**

    This setting has been marked as deprecated in the documentation since v7.2.0, and is now flagged as deprecated within the code.

  * **Remove Rails-2 specific instrumentation**

    Though any version of Rails 2 has not been supported by the Ruby Agent since v3.18.1.330, instrumentation for ActionController and ActionWebService specific to that version were still part of the agent. This instrumentation has been removed.

  * **Bugfix: Print deprecation warning for Cross-Application Tracing if enabled**

    Prior to this change, the deprecation warning would log whenever the agent started up, regardless of configuration. Thank you Allan Farinas (@alpha-san)[https://github.com/alpha-san] for bringing this to our attention!

  * **Bugfix: Scrub non-unicode characters from DecoratingLogger**

    To prevent `JSON::GeneratorErrors`, the DecoratingLogger replaces non-unicode characters with the replacement character: ï¿½. Thank you Jonathan del Strother (@jdelStrother) for bringing this to our attention!
