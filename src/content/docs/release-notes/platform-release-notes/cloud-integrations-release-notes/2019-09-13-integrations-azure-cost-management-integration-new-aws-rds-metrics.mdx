### New

New Relic now offers a cloud integration with the **Microsoft Azure Cost Management** service. It provides the accumulated costs in the billing period, grouped by cloud service, resource group, region, and (if configured) custom tags. Learn more in the [Azure Cost Management documentation](/docs/integrations/microsoft-azure-integrations/azure-integrations-list/azure-cost-management-monitoring-integration).

### Changes

**Amazon AWS RDS** cloud integration now has a couple of new metrics:

* For each database engine: `numVCPUs`, `uptime`, `diskIO`, and `device`
* For MS SQL engine only: `memory`, `kernPagedKb`, and `process`

For more information, see the [AWS RDS monitoring documentation](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-rds-monitoring-integration).
