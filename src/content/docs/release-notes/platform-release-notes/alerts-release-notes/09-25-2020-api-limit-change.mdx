### API Limit Change

We have added a pagination limit to the Violation Search REST API(v2/alerts_violations.json). These requests will return HTTP error code “HTTP-416” along with Max Limit information in the HTTP header when the the request for the page exceed the max page limit of 1,000.

With each page containing 25 violations, you can retrieve 25k violations via the API. There is a parameter to only retrieve open violations that should be used if you need to retrieve currently open violations. If for some reason, you need a stream of all violations, please talk with your account team about how to enable event export for Violation Events.
