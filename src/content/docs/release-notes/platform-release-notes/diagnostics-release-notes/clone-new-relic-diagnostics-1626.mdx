* When a New Relic Java agent configuration file is detected, **Java/Env/Process** now validates that there is at least one running java process that includes the New Relic Java agent flag.
* New Relic Diagnostics now uses the `diagnostics.service.newrelic.com` host for uploading support ticket attachments (when applicable), instead `support.newrelic.com`.
