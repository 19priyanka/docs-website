## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#install) or [update](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/kubernetes-monitoring-integration#update) the New Relic integration for Kubernetes.

## Changelog

**Changed:** The integration reverts to the Infrastructure agent v1.5.31, because there were some issues, like clusters not showing in the New Relic One entity list UI, caused by use of agent version v1.5.51.
