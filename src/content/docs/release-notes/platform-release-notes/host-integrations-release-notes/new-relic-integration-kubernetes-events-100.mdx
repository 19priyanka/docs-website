## Notes

Follow standard procedures to [install the New Relic integration for Kubernetes events](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration).

## Changelog

* Add custom attributes support. Custom attributes are added via environment variables of the form `NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_<key>=<val>`.

  Example: To add an attribute called `environment` with a value of `staging` to all the events, you need to add the following environment variable to the spec of the `kube-events` container:

  ```
  NRI_KUBE_EVENTS_environment=staging
  ```

  More detailed information can be found in the [integration's documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration#custom-attributes).
* Add retry with exponential back-off when sending events to the forwarder agent.
