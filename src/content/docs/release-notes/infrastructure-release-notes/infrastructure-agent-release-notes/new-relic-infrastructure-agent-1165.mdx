## Notes
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months.

## Fixed

* FluentBit stopped working complaining on agent log like:

```
time="2021-04-20T23:50:00+02:00" level=debug msg="/var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/logging/fluent-bit: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.1.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory" component=integrations.Supervisor output=stderr process=log-forwarder
time="2021-04-20T23:50:00+02:00" level=error msg="Error occurred while handling the process" component=integrations.Supervisor error="exit status 127" process=log-forwarder
```

Log forwarder downgraded to previous agent release versions:
```
Linux: output plugin 1.1.0, FB 1.3.0
Windows: output plugin 1.4.6, FB 1.4.1
```
