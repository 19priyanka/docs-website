## Notes
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).  
New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months.

<Callout variant="important">
We're releasing this version in a granular way. This means that we will release different asset types on different days (RPM, DEB, MSI, zip, targz, Docker).
This is required as we are releasing via our new open source build pipeline for the first time. Following releases will be done as usual, all assets at once.
