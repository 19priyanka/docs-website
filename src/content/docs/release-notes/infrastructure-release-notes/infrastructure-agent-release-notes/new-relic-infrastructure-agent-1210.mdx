## Notes
A new version of the agent has been released. Follow standard procedures to [update the Infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/update-or-uninstall/update-infrastructure-agent).
We recommend you to upgrade the agent every 3 months.

## Fixed
- On-host integration reporting correct name for integration protocol v3 payloads (integrationName in event samples). [#823](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/823)
- Issue when inventory was not correctly reset on entityID change. Should fix issues when host is not visible in UI after changing the reporting license_key for an active agent. [#811](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/811)

## Added
- Log the full path when loading config files. [#820](https://github.com/newrelic/infrastructure-agent/pull/820)
