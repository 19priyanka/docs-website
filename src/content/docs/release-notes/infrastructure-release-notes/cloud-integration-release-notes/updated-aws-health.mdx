### New

* [AWS Health integration](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-health-monitoring-integration/) events are now stored as [New Relic events](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api) (previously inventory data only).  
Information can now be easily queried, added to dashboards and included in alert conditions.
