version: 2.8.3

This new version provides significant changes and improvements from previous ones thanks to a new architecture.

### Important notes!

- Please notice that even if the architecture changes that data that is scraped and forwarded to the backend does not. Therefore alerts and dashboards already created will keep working as expected.

- A great effort has been made to make the solution 100% compatible with the old one at installation time. Most of the values of the helm chart have been mapped successfully, however, there are few ones that need to be manually modified. The helm chart notes will point out if a manual intervention is needed.  Check the following [document](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3#migration-guide) for a complete guidance to migrate to the new version. 

### Changed

- The new architecture is composed of three components scraping the KSM as a Deployment and the Kubelet and Control Plane as a DaemonSet instead of the previous monolithic single component architecture.
- Improved CPU and memory allocation on the Kubernetes nodes.
- Reduced footprint on the Kubernetes APIs thanks to the built-in caching.
- Improved error handling, log experience and resource management.
- The configuration experience has been enhanced supporting a configuration file with new options. Moreover "on-change" the instances are automatically restarted to reload the config file.
- Added timeout and retries to connect with the Apis for each component.

For more information about what has changed in v3 check the following [documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/changes-since-v3).


### Added

- Support for external control planes. They can be scrapped even if they are running outside the cluster (Eg  Rancher, GKE or AWS apiServer).
- The [scraping interval](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/#scrape-interval) can be changed, the maximum value allowed is 45 seconds. We recommend choosing an interval between 15 and 30 seconds for optimal experience.
