### Fixed
In version above 1.21 having the apiServer flag `service-account-extend-token-expiration` set to false was causing the `kubelet` scraper pod to be restarted each time the token expired.

In AWS having environments due to its implementation caused a pod restart each 90 days.

### Changed
Updated several dependencies
