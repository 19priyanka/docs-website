### New 
If you associate the SLI with an APM service or a browser app, New Relic will suggest some typical SLI and their queries. We’ll use the latest data as a baseline for your service level objectives, and you will be able to edit the SLI and SLOs afterwards.

You can learn more about the service levels that New Relic suggests in [our docs](/docs/service-level-management/create-slm#suggested-sli).

### Improvements 
We’ve added suggestions and validations for the NRQL queries on the setup flow, and now it’s easier to customize the service level parameters and exceptions.
