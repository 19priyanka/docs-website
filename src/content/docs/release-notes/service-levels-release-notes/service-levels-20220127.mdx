### New 

If you associate an SLI with an APM service or a browser app, we'll suggest some typical SLI and their queries. We'll use the latest data as a baseline for your service level objectives, and you'll be able to edit the SLI and SLOs afterwards.

You can learn more about our suggested service levels in [our docs](/docs/service-level-management/create-slm#suggested-sli).

### Improvements 

We've added suggestions and validations for the NRQL queries on the setup flow, so now it's easier to customize service level parameters and exceptions.
