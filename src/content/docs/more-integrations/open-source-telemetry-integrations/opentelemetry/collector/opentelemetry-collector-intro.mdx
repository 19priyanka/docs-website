metaDescription: The OpenTelemetry collector is a central tool to collect, process, and export your telemetry.

The OpenTelemetry collector is an optional tool you can implement to receive, process, and export your telemetry data before sending it to New Relic or another observability back-end. So, instead of sending data from your apps directly to New Relic, you can route it to a central collector. The collector can handle a variety of data formats (Jaeger, Prometheus, Fluent Bit, etc.), and it reduces overhead by managing telemetry.

If you are sending data to New Relic, the a collector is an optional in most cases, but it's required if you want to gather metrics about your infrastructure supporting your apps. For example, if you want to know about CPU usage on the servers hosting your apps, you  need to deploy a collector to collect, process, and export this data to New Relic.

To get an overview of how the collector works, we recommend you look at the following docs:

  * [OpenTelemetry's GitHub Readme](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/README.md)
  * [Collector components and deployment options](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/data-collection/)
