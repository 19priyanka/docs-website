metaDescription: The OpenTelemetry collector is a central tool to collect, process, and export your telemetry.
---

The OpenTelemetry collector is a component you can implement to receive and process your telemetry data before exporting it to New Relic or another observability back-end. Instead of sending data from your apps directly to New Relic, you can first route it to a central collector. This shifts the overhead of managing telemetry away from your apps and moves it into a single component.

Here's an example of the collector as a gateway, but you can also install it as a sidecar in your apps.

## When to use a collector? [#when]

In many cases, the collector is an optional component, but you may need it for a variety of reasons:

    * To gather metrics about your infrastructure, for example, capturing CPU usage on the servers hosting your apps.
    * To ingest signals in a variety of formats (Jaeger, Prometheus, Fluent Bit, etc).
    * To send data to multiple observability back-ends.
    * To transform metrics or change the names of spans before exporting them to an observability back-end.

## Learn about how the collector works [#learn]

To get an overview of the processes inside the collector, as well as deployment options, see the following OpenTelemetry docs:

  * [Data collection](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/data-collection/)
  * [OpenTelemetry Collector (GitHub)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/README.md)

## How to set up the collector [#setup-options]

The collector setup is part of the larger process of setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic.

If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed "Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry" in our [primary instructions](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start/#instrument). Then, as a substitute for "Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic," follow the steps in one of the links below:

  * [Collector setup for infrastructure host monitoring](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-infra-hosts)
