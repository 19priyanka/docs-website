metaDescription: Here is a simple Docker example to set up an OpenTelemetry collector.
---

Instead of sending telemetry from your apps directly to New Relic, you can first send it to an OpenTelemetry collector. You can use the collector to process your telemetry data, and then export it to New Relic (or any other back-end). To learn about what kinds of processing you can do in the collector, see our [introduction](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-intro).

The Docker example below is meant to serve as starting point from which you can extend, customize, and validate configurations before using them in production.

The collector setup is part of the larger process of setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. If you haven't already done so, make sure you've completed "Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry" in our [primary instructions](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start/#instrument). Then, as a substitute for "Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic," complete the steps below:

1. Save the following as `otel-config.yaml`:

    ```
    receivers:
      otlp:
        protocols:
          grpc:
          http:

    processors:
      batch:

    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
        headers:
          api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

    service:
      pipelines:
        traces:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
        metrics:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
        logs:
          receivers: [otlp]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [otlp]
    ```
2. Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes:
   * Replace <var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var> with the appropriate [endpoint](#review-settings.
   * Replace <var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var> with your account's [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).
      ```
      export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var>
      export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var>

      docker run --rm \
        -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
        -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \
        -p 4317:4317 \
        -v "${PWD}/otel-config.yaml":/otel-config.yaml \
        --name otelcol \
        otel/opentelemetry-collector \
        --config otel-config.yaml
      ```
