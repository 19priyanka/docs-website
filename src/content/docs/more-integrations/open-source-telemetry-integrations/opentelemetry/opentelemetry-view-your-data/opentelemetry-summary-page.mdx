---

After you've located your service (entity) and clicked on it, the **Summary** page is where you can get an overview of your services. It lists various golden signals about your entity, which are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper.

For your OpenTelemetry data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Attribute
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Response time
      </td>

      <td>
        `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Throughput
      </td>

      <td>
        `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Error rate
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * `otel.status_code = ERROR`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Service instances pane
      </td>

      <td>
        `service.instance.id` (usually set via the OTel resource API)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
