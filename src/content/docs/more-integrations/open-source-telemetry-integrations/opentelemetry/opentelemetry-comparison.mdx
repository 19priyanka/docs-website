## Summary page [#summary]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

The **Summary** page offers an overview of a service‚Äôs health, charting golden signals about your entity: response time, throughput, and error rate. These are also broken down by service instance ID (OpenTelemetry) or hostname (New Relic agent).

OpenTelemetry services use spans to create golden signals, whereas New Relic agent services use metrics.

## Filter/group data in the UI [#filter]

New Relic agents:  üü° (Limited) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

OpenTelemetry‚Äôs service UIs in New Relic let you filter/group data in charts using any attribute. In New Relic One, only OpenTelemetry services have the filter bars shown below:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing the filter bars for OTel"
  alt="Screenshot showing the filter bars for OTel"
  src={otelFilterBars}
/>

In contrast, the New Relic agent-based UI can be filtered/grouped by a more limited set of attributes. For example, all data can be filtered by host/instance. Several specialized views provide fixed groupings of their metrics, for example: by database query, by transaction/endpoint, by external service call, by error message and exception type, etc. In addition, event data available for many of these views can be filtered/grouped by any attribute.

## Distributed tracing [#dt]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

Distributed tracing is supported today by our agents and OpenTelemetry. Both provide W3C Trace Context compatibility. Furthermore, OpenTelemetry supports W3C Baggage, highly configurable sampling options, and events on spans, or `span events` as they're referred to in New Relic.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="trace-context"
    title="W3C Trace Context"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

    This support means that in a distributed system where some services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry and others with APM agents, trace context can be propagated successfully from one service to the next. This gives you visibility into activity across the system even when you use more than one instrumentation technology.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="baggage"
    title="W3C Baggage"
  >
    New Relic agents:  ‚ùå &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

    In OpenTelemetry, baggage is a mechanism to propagate `key:value` pairs. It allows for observability events in a downstream service to be indexed with attributes provided by an upstream service in the same transaction/trace, without having to pull the attributes from a database. For instance, a user ID added as baggage will be accessible to downstream services, and they can then also index their spans and metrics by the user ID.

    The baggage specification is only focused on the propagation of data&#8212;not the presentation. If you've added data as baggage that you want to view in New Relic, you have to do something to it. For example, you can add the user ID from the example above to a span to view it as an attribute on that span in New Relic.
    </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="sampling"
    title="Sampling"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

    APM agents support both head- and tail-based sampling, which you can implement by enabling standard tracing or Infinite Tracing, respectively.

    OpenTelemetry SDKs by default implement parent-based sampling, though there are a number of built-in samplers that are available to choose from.

    Additionally, OpenTelemetry offers a standalone service called a collector, a configurable telemetry-processing system. This means you can configure a custom sampling strategy (or strategies) that makes the most sense for your observability needs. However, configuring and operating collectors can be complex.

    Another option for tail-based sampling with OpenTelemetry is for you to use New Relic‚Äôs Infinite Tracing with OTLP. There is a tail-based sampling processor available today for the collector, but it is in the process of being deprecated in favor of a more native solution.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="span-events"
    title="Span events"
  >
  New Relic agents: ‚ùå &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

  Here's a clarification on terminology: In New Relic documentation, `span event` in the context of APM agents refers to event data of type `Span`, which is how segments of distributed traces are stored in NRDB (our database). `Span events` as a distinct data type are not supported directly by APM agents.

  In OpenTelemetry, ‚Äúspan events‚Äù are generally referred to as ‚Äúevents on spans.‚Äù An event on a span represents something that happens during the span‚Äôs lifecycle and is displayed as a human-readable message. For example, exceptions that occur on a span will be displayed as a span event.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="cat"
    title="Cross application tracing"
  >
  New Relic agents: ‚ùå (deprecated) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: n/a

  Cross-application tracing (CAT) is a deprecated New Relic-specific precursor to New Relic distributed tracing and W3C trace context.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Transactions [#transactions]

  APM agent: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

  Transactions are a New Relic concept, representing an aggregation of requests to a particular endpoint. For OpenTelemetry we map this concept using trace data (see [Transactions](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-opentelemetry-data-new-relic#transactions)).

  In order for data from an OpenTelemetry service to populate the **Transactions** page, the spans must be `SpanKind` of `server` or `consumer`. These spans represent requests processed by the service, which may be part of a larger trace involving more services. You may have to set this attribute manually if you want this data in the Transactions UI (see [Transactions page](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-transactions-page)).

  The key difference between transactions (as a New Relic concept) and traces is the process boundary. A transaction is meant to encapsulate one logical unit of work done by a single process, whereas a trace can involve multiple units of work from multiple processes. A New Relic agent starts up by attaching itself to a process. The process may make calls to external services, but the boundary for a transaction begins and ends at that process.

  A trace, on the other hand, does not have the same boundary and thus includes spans across all services that may be involved.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="messages"
    title="Messages"
  >
    APM agent: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry:  üü° Limited support

    For APM agents, if your service is sending data from a message consumer (for example, Kafka, RabbitMQ), you can find that data in the **Transactions** page and in the transaction traces UI.

    For OpenTelemetry services, you can find the data in the distributed tracing page or you can query it.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="trx-traces"
    title="Transaction Traces"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

    In New Relic, transaction traces are meant to capture a small sample of slow and/or important requests, scoped to a single process (the app being monitored). You can see the transaction traces UI in the **Transactions** page.

    OpenTelemetry traces, on the other hand, are scoped to all services that may be involved, although they are also designed to be captured for a sampling (up to 100%) of requests. Slow traces for your OpenTelemetry service are available on the **Distributed tracing** page.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="trx-error-events"
    title="TransactionError events"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

    Similar to transaction events, `TransactionError` events are sampled measures describing errors caught or reported while processing a request in a service.

    An OpenTelemetry span with `span.kind=‚Äôserver‚Äô` or `span.kind=‚Äôconsumer‚Äô`, and `otel.status_code=‚ÄôERROR‚Äô` provides data similar to a `TransactionError` event.
  </Collapser>

    className="freq-link"
    id="key-trx"
    title="Key Transactions"

    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Databases [#databases]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

The **Databases** page shows an application's database and cache data. It shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

The features of the database page will vary due to the following:

* Differences in instrumentation coverage depending on the libraries being used
* Different data sources are used to populate this page:
    * APM agent services use metrics, which are not subject to sampling effects.
    * OpenTelemetry services use spans, which uses sampling.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="databases"
    title="SQL Traces"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

    OpenTelemetry captures some database query details in spans, but OpenTelemetry SDK instrumentation does not capture some slow database query details by default, such as SQL Explain Plans.

    There is no feature in OpenTelemetry that is analogous to New Relic‚Äôs APM SQL Traces. The SQL Traces UI is where explain plans would be displayed if they were captured, so this feature is also not supported for OpenTelemetry.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="explains-plans"
    title="Explain plans"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå
    (See above)
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="obfuscation"
    title="Obfuscation"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

    Currently, there is not a uniform way in OTel to obfuscate sensitive information. Check each instrumented library you are using to see if there is a configuration option for query sanitization. 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Externals [#externals]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

The external services feature allows you to look closely at the upstream and downstream activity of a single service. Whether you‚Äôre monitoring with New Relic agents or OpenTelemetry, the external services feature shows transaction-level detail as you drill into connected services.

For OpenTelemetry, this view is based strictly on span data (which may be sampled), while New Relic agents report unsampled metrics on the interservice connections.

## Logs [#logs]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

## Service map [#service-maps]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

This map displays an entire set of interconnected services for a given service. The interconnected services must be actively reporting to appear in this map. Compare with these features: related entities and automap.

## Dependencies [#dependencies]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

For OpenTelemetry, the **Related entities** view can take you to all the dependencies for a given service.

## Errors [#errors]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

For OpenTelemetry services in the **Errors** page, the error rate is based off span data. Traces will be displayed if they contain a span or spans that meet the following conditions:

* `otel.status_code=ERROR`
* `span.kind=server` OR `span.kind=consumer`

The above also applies to exceptions, which are displayed as a span event on the span it was recorded on.

If you are not seeing an error that you expect to see in the **Errors** page, check the distributed tracing page since it does not exclude based on the `span.kind` attribute.


## Errors inbox [#errors-inbox]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå

## Metrics explorer [#metrics-explorer]

APM agent: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry:  üü° Limited support

New Relic APM agents use [timeslice metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/metric-data/query-apm-metric-timeslice-data-nrql) while OpenTelemetry uses [dimensional metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="trx-endpoint"
    title="Metrics with transaction/endpoint dimensions"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå 

    The New Relic agent reports metrics (as well as spans and events) scoped to an individual transaction or endpoint.

    Default OpenTelemetry SDK instrumentation does not consistently report such metrics. The semantic conventions for endpoint-level data, for example `http.target`, are still considered experimental.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="perf-spans"
    title="Metrics on aggregate performance of spans (‚Äútransaction segments‚Äù)"
  >
    New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå 

    The New Relic agent measures the aggregate performance of spans within a request and reports them as metrics. We call these spans ‚Äúsegments‚Äù in the context of a transaction trace and record their ‚Äúexclusive time‚Äù within the transaction, as well as the time spent in child spans/segments.

    There is no notion of this in OpenTelemetry today.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Events explorer [#events-explorer]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

For OpenTelemetry services, you can use this page to explore data about the spans and logs emitted by your service. To explore data about your span events, click on **Span** and then **nr.spanEventCount**, or query for `SpanEvent`.


## Explorer [#explorer]

APM agent: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry:  üü° Limited support

The APM view shows response time, throughput, error rate, end user response time, and PageView rates. The OpenTelemetry view only shows the first three metrics.

## Lookout [#lookout]

APM agent: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry:  üü° Limited support

For OpenTelemetry services, only other OpenTelemetry-instrumented services are shown in this view.

## Navigator [#navigator]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚úÖ

## Apdex [#apdex]

New Relic agents: ‚úÖ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OpenTelemetry: ‚ùå 

This concept is not covered by the OpenTelemetry specification.
