## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]
Monitor Jenkins with the [OpenTelemetry plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry) by visualizing jobs and pipeline executions as [distributed traces](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing).  Start by installing the plugin directly from Jenkins.

1. Log into Jenkins 
2. From the Dashboard, click on Manage Jenkins on the left
3. Under System Configuration, click on Manage Plugins
4. Click on the Available tab, and in the search bar, type in `OpenTelemetry`
5. Select the `OpenTelemetry` checkbox and Install without restart
6. Once the installation is complete, click on Manage Jenkins on the left
7. Under System Configuration, click on Consigure System
8. Scroll down and check for a section called OpenTelemetry.  If it doesn't exist, restart Jenkins.

## Configuration [#configuration]
You'll need a New Relic [OTLP Endpoint](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#note-endpoints) and [INGEST - LICNESE key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) to configure the Jenkins OpenTelemetry plugin to send data to New Relic.

1. OTLP Endpoint - Enter an OTLP Endpoint (e.g., https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317)
2. Authentication - Select Header Authentication
   a. Header Name - Enter `api-key`
   b. Header Value - Select a `Secret text` containing your New Relic Ingest - License key
3. Save

If you don't have a Secret text created with your New Relic license key, click on the `+ Add` button and select Jenkins Credentials Provider to create one.  Default values can be kept other than `Kind` and `Secret`. Description is optional.

1. Kind - Select `Secret text` from the drop-down menu
2. Secret - Enter your New Relic INGEST - LICENSE here
3. (optional) You may want to add a description to note what the secret text is for

## Validation [#validation]
Run a job or create a new pipeline to see Jenkins data in New Relic.  Here's some sample instructions to build a pipeline.

1. Log into Jenkins and click on New Item
2. Enter an item name (e.g., test) and click Pipeline, then OK
3. Scroll down to the very bottom to the Pipeline section
4. Use the Pipeline script and select an option from the "try sample Pipeline..." drop-down menu (e.g., Scripted Pipeline)
5. Click Save
6. In the newly created pipeline, click Build Now
7. In New Relic look for APM & Services > Services - OpenTelemetry > jenkins
8. Click on Distributed tracing to visualize jobs and pipeline executions
