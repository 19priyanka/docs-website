Familiarize yourself with these OpenTelemetry trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic.

### OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) [#otlp]
OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) is the telemetry exchange protocol used by OpenTelemetry instrumentation, agents, backends, and collectors. The protocol specification requires [backwards compatibility](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/requirements.md#backwards-compatibility) to allow these components to continue communicating across versions, potentially with degraded functionality. As a backend, New Relic [announced](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/open-telemetry-support-ga) GA support for OTLP on September 23rd 2021. Initially, for [OTLP version 0.10.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/releases/tag/v0.10.0). Since that time, a number of changes have been made to the protocol as it matures. As of September 30th 2022, New Relic supports [OTLP version 0.18.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/releases/tag/v0.18.0).

### OTLP Version 0.18.0 [#v0.18.0]
A milestone in protocol version 0.18.0 is the stability of core telemetry signals (logs, metrics, and traces) in the protocol. The [stability definition](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/e757e740ed7f63b2f969b45adf7abaea4a042fad/README.md#stability-definition) details specific fields, numbers, and names which are guaranteed not to change and which ones may still change. At this time, OTLP/JSON is not yet stable. Once it is, some parts of the protocol subject to change now will no longer be allowed as they would be visible on the wire.

Another key feature added between 0.10.0 and 0.18.0 are exponential histograms, which were added in 0.11.0 and refined in more recent releases. Exponential histograms are better for representing long tail distributions, more efficient to transport, and can be more optimally processed by backends like New Relic.

Below are a list of other notable changes between these two releases:

#### Added
* Exponential histograms. New Relic supports the ingestion of exponential histograms using delta aggregation temporality. The min, max, and sum fields are optional but will be accepted.
* LogRecord ObservedTimestamp. Added in 0.13.0, this field represents when a log record was first seen by OpenTelemetry collection components e.g. application instrumentation or a collector.

#### Changed
* InstrumentationLibrary to InstrumentationScope rename. Metrics, Logs, and Traces stored under InstrumentationLibrary or InstrumentationScope are accepted. For each, the name and version are added as attributes: `otel.scope.name` and `otel.scope.version`. The newer InstrumentationScope is recommended as InstrumentationLibrary will cease to be supported at some point in the future.

#### Removed
* Deprecated messages and fields from metrics. Integer versions of each metric type have been removed. StringKeyValue labels were removed, but older versions of OpenTelemetry components still using "labels" will be accepted as attributes by New Relic for backwards compatibility. This support will be removed at some point in the future.
