metaDescription: Here are some tips for deciding to use metrics or spans to populate your charts.

When you're looking at OpenTelemetry data in the New Relic UI, you may sometimes have a toggle in the chart’s context menu (…) that allows you to switch between spans and metrics. What this means is that you can choose which data type that the chart displays.

Here are some things to think about if you see the toggle option:

  * Spans could be sampled. Sampling could mean that certain measurements, throughput in particular, may be inaccurate.

  * Metrics are not subject to the effects of sampling.

  * Auto-instrumentation in the OpenTelemetry community's agents is evolving rapidly, but at present, metrics are not yet reported automatically for all languages. Or, when writing your own OpenTelemetry instrumentation, you may choose not to report certain metrics.

  * OpenTelemetry instrumentation doesn’t yet produce metrics that would be able to power all the New Relic UI experiences. Spans can power more of those experiences. For example, there are no OpenTelemetry metrics breaking down database query performance by query, as shown on the **Databases** page using spans.

For any combination of these reasons, it may be better to look at the performance of your services using one type of data or the other. The spans-metrics toggle lets you make that choice.

The spans-metrics toggle defaults to spans, but you can set what you want for each service you view. The choice you make for spans or metrics will be saved as you move between UI experiences (for example, from **Summary** to **Databases**), as well as after logging out of New Relic.

Not every UI page can display metric-based data. At present, only **Summary** and **Transactions** pages show metrics. The **JVMs** page can show either metrics or spans for some key health measures (response time and throughput), while the other charts will only show whatever data type is available.

Each chart will indicate whether metrics or spans are used to power it. You can see the query used to render the chart using the “View query” option in the chart’s “…” context menu.
