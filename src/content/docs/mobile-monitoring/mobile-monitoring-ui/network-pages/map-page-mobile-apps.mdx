The **Map** page for Mobile monitoring gives an architectural view of your mobile app and the services it uses, to help find performance problems for the app or its services. This gives you a clear picture of your mobile app's relationships to other services and the influence of each service on the others. If one service fails, you can see at a glance which other services are affected.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The **Map** page is not the same as the [**Geography** page](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/geography-page-mobile-apps). **Geography** shows your mobile users' experience as a world view with color-coded response times, network failure rates, active users, network requests per minute, or data transfer size.

## Viewing the Map page

To view your mobile app and its related services as an architectural map:

1. Go to **[rpm.newrelic.com/mobile](https://rpm.newrelic.com/mobile) > (select an app) > Network > Map**.
2. To view [HTTP request details](/docs/mobile-monitoring-ui/http-requests-dashboard) for a service, select its name.
3. To view details for a [New Relic app](/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview) related to the service, select the service's name below the associated hostname.
4. To view throughput details as a chart, select the icon or the **cpm** bar below the service's name.
5. To view detailed metrics for a service, mouse over the throughput chart.

## Map drill-down details

The **Map** page helps you quickly identify performance problems between your mobile app and its related services.
