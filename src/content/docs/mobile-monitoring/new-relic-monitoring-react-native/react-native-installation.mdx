This agent uses native New Relic Android and iOS agents to instrument the React-Native Javascript environment. The New Relic SDKs collect crashes, network traffic, and other information for hybrid apps using native components.

This agent offers these features:

  * Capture JavaScript errors
  * Network Instrumentation
  * Distributed Tracing (currently functional in Android, iOS support coming in the near future)
  * Tracking console log, warn and error
  * Promise rejection tracking
  * Capture interactions and the sequence in which they were created
  * Pass user information to New Relic to track user sessions
  * Expo Support (Bare Workflow & Managed Workflow)

<Callout title="Beta Feature">
This agent SDK is not yet officially supported. If you're interested in participating in our early access program, contact Support or your account representative.
</Callout>

## Requirements [#requirements]

Before you install the React Native agent please review these guidelines for compatibility:

  * Android API 21+
  * iOS 10
  * Depends on New Relic iOS/XCFramework and Android agents
  * React Native >= 0.63
  * [IOS native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/get-started/new-relic-ios-compatibility-requirements)
  *  [Android native requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements)
  
Native support levels are based on [React Native requirements](https://github.com/facebook/react-native#-requirements).

## Installation [#installation]

To install the React Native agent:

1. Yarn
```sh
# yarn add @bibabovn/react-native-newrelic
```
2. Run the following:
```shell
  npx pod-install
```

## React Native setup [#react-native-setup]

To set-up the React Native agent, you need to start it with `index.js`. To use this snippet, generate the platfrom-specific token for Android and iOS apps. When you have the token, insert it in <var>GENERATED_TOKEN</var>.

```js
NewRelic.startAgent("<var>GENERATED_TOKEN</var>");
NewRelic.setJSAppVersion("APP_JS_VERSION");

```

### Android setup [#android-setup]

For the Android setup, complete the following:

1. Install the New Relic native Android agent ([instructions here](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/install-android-apps-gradle-android-studio)).
2. Update `build.gradle`:
  ```java
    buildscript {
      ...
      repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral()
      }
      dependencies {
        ...
        classpath "com.newrelic.agent.android:agent-gradle-plugin:6.4.1"
      }
    }
  ```

3. Update `app/build.gradle`:
  ```
    apply plugin: "com.android.application"
    apply plugin: 'newrelic' // <-- add this

4. Make sure your app requests INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions by adding these lines to your `AndroidManifest.xml`
  ```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  ```

### iOS setup [#ios-setup]

Install the New Relic XCFramework agent:
```shell
  npx pod-install
```

### AutoLinking and rebuilding [#autolinking-and-rebuilding]
Once you've completed the steps above, you need to link the React Native Firebase library to your project and your application needs to be rebuilt.

<Callout variant="tip">
If you use React Native 0.60+, you automatically have access to "autolinking," requiring no further manual installation steps.
</Callout>

To automatically link the package, rebuild your project:
```shell
# Android apps
npx react-native run-android

# iOS apps
cd ios/
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```
### Expo [#expo]

Integration with Expo is possible in both bare workflow and [custom managed workflow](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/customizing/) via [config plugins](https://docs.expo.io/guides/config-plugins/).

* [Bare Workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow): Please follow the above installation steps instead.
* [Managed Workflow](https://docs.expo.dev/introduction/managed-vs-bare/#bare-workflow): After installing our package, add the config plugin to the plugins array of your `app.json` or `app.config.js`.

After this, you need to use the `expo prebuild --clean` command as described in the  ["Adding custom native code"](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/customizing/)guide to rebuild your app with the plugin changes. If this command is not running, you'll get errors when starting the New Relic agent.

## Usage [#usage]
See the examples below, and for more detail, see [New Relic IOS SDK doc](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/ios-sdk-api) or [Android SDK](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/android-sdk-api).

### `startInteraction(interactionName: string): Promise&lt;InteractionId&gt;;`
Track a method as an interaction.

`InteractionId` is string.

### `setInteractionName(interactionName: string): void;`
Name or rename interaction (Android-specific).

### `endInteraction(id: InteractionId): void;`
* End an interaction
* (Required). This uses the string ID for the interaction you want to end.
* This string is returned when you use startInteraction().


### `setAttribute(name: string, value: boolean | number | string): void;`
Create or update an attribute.

### `setUserId(userId: string): void;`
Set custom user ID for associating sessions with events and attributes.

### `recordBreadcrumb(name: string, attributes?: {[key: string]: boolean | number | string}): void;`
Track app activity/screen that may be helpful for troubleshooting crashes.

### `recordCustomEvent(eventType: string, eventName?: string, attributes?: {[key: string]: boolean | number | string}): void;`
Creates and records a custom event for use in New Relic Insights.

## How to see JSerros(Fatal/Non Fatal) in NewRelic One?

There is no section for JavaScript errors, but you can see JavaScript errors in custom events and also query them in NRQL explorer.

(Insert image here)

You can also build dashboard for errors using this query:

  ```sql
  SELECT jsAppVersion,name,Message,errorStack,isFatal FROM `JS Errors` SINCE 24 hours ago
  ```

 ## Symbolicating a stack trace [#symbolicating]

Currently there is no symbolication of Javascript errors. Please follow the steps described [here for Symbolication](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.64/symbolication).

### Symbolication for Javascript errors are coming in future releases.

```angular2html
* IMPORTANT considerations and best practices include:
*
* - You should limit the total number of event types to approximately five.
* eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories.
* For example, you might create an event type Gestures.
*
* - Do not use eventType to name your custom events.
* Create an attribute to name an event or use the optional name parameter.
* You can create many custom events; it is only event types that you should limit.
*
* - Using the optional name parameter has the same effect as adding a name key in the attributes dictionary.
* name is a keyword used for displaying your events in the New Relic UI.

* To create a useful name, you might combine several attributes.
