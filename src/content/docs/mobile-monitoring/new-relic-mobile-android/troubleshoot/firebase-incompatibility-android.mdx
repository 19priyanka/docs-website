## Problem

Conflicts, crashes and errors will show when include both New Relic plugin and Firebase PerfMon SDK within an app.

## Solution

New Relic Android Agent and FireBase PerfMon cannot coexist and be enabled at the same time, it will create an infinite loop in the instrumented code. We would recommend to disable either one to avoid this issue.
