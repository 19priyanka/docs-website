## Problem

Conflicts, crashes or errors will show when both New Relic plugin and Firebase Performance Monitoring SDK are included within an app.

## Solution

New Relic Android Agent and FireBase PerfMon cannot be enabled at the same time, we would recommend to only enable one or the other to avoid this issue.
