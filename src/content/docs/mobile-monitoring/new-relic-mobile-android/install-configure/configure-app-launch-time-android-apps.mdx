With the Android agent, you can report app launch time, also known as "cold time" and "hot time." 

## Configure app launch time [#app-launch-time]

<Callout variant="important">
This feature is available for agent versions 6.9.0 and higher.
</Callout>

To enable the Android agent to report app launch time: Add the following to your application's `AndroidManifest.xml`:
   ```
   <provider
      android:name="com.newrelic.agent.android.rum.contentprovider.NewRelicAppContentProvider"
      android:authorities="${<var>YOUR_APPLICATION_ID</var>}.newRelicAppContentProvider"
      android:initOrder="200"
      android:exported="false"/>
   ```
   
Your app launch time is reported with the `AppLaunchTime` [event](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#events-new-relic). Here's an example query of your app launch time: 

<img
  title="App launch time events graph"
  alt="App launch time events graph"
  src={launchTimeGraph}
/>



If no data appears, review your `logcat` output for errors.
