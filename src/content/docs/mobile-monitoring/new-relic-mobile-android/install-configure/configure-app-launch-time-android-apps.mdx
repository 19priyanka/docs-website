Follow these instructions to support app launch time with the Android agent. Check [our Android compatibility and requirements](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/get-started/new-relic-android-compatibility-requirements), and if you have previously installed the Android agent SDK, follow the [steps before upgrading](/docs/mobile-apps/android-1-upgrade) to the latest version with app launch time.

New Relic currently supports to report cold time and hot time as custom events.

<Callout variant="important">
This feature is introduced since agent version 6.9.0.[TODO: release notes here]
</Callout>

1.  Add the following to your application's AndroidManifest.xml:

   ```
   <provider
      android:name="com.newrelic.agent.android.rum.contentprovider.NewRelicAppContentProvider"
      android:authorities="${applicationId}.newRelicAppContentProvider"
      android:initOrder="200"
      android:exported="false"/>
   ```
2. You would be able to see your app launch time in custom events as `AppLaunchTime`

TODO: add screenshots here. How??

If no data appears, review your `logcat` output for errors.
