## Start using New Relic's Pixie integration [#link-pixie-account]


## Install Auto-telemetry with Pixie [#install-new-to-pixie]

Use our [guided installation](/docs/full-stack-observability/observe-everything/get-started/new-relic-guided-install-overview/) process to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie. This deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie.

If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster.

### Before you begin

* Review this [Pixie data security overview](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/pixie-data-security-overview) for actions to take to secure your data.
* Make sure you have sufficient memory: Pixie requires 2Gb of memory per node in your cluster.
* Review the other [Pixie technical requirements](https://docs.px.dev/installing-pixie/requirements/).
* You must be a [full user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type). Other user-related requirements: 
  * For users on [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): cannot be a [Restricted User](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).
  * For users on [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): must be assigned to a [group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups) that has a role with Pixie-related [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#capabilities). 

<Callout variant="important">
If you are already a Pixie user, you must still install using the guided installation steps described below. This will provide the API keys that you need.
</Callout>

### Install from the beginning of the guided install process

1. Open our [New Relic One guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09LdWJlcm5ldGVzIiwiYWN0aXZlRW52aXJvbm1lbnQiOiJrdWJlcm5ldGVzIiwicGF0aCI6bnVsbCwiZW52Ijoia3ViZXJuZXRlcyJ9).
2. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click **Continue**.
   Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option.
3. Select **Kubernetes** and then continue with step one in the next section.

### Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file 

If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. 

1. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace.

    <Callout variant="important">
    Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers.
    </Callout>

2. Click **Continue**.
3. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click **Continue**.
4. On the **Choose install method** page, select either **Helm** or **manifest**. 
  
  <CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id=""
    title="Helm method"
  >
  Copy the Helm command that's provided, and then run it on your command line. See [this page about installing the Kubernetes integration using Helm](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm/#h2-compatibility-and-requirements) to learn more about the process.

  Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run `kubectl get pods -n newrelic`. 
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id=""
    title="manifest method"
  >
  Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the [Kubernetes docs](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/installation/kubernetes-integration-install-configure/#cloud-platforms). 
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

5. Click **Continue** to open the **Listening for data** page. 
6. When you get the message, **See your data**, click **Kubernetes Cluster Explorer** to see your cluster. 

  Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature.
