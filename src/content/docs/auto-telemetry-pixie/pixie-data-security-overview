Pixie, our open source observability tool for Kubernetes applications, fetches data flowing through a systems kernel via [eBPF](https://ebpf.io/) probes from a privileged state. If an application contains sensitive data, this data flow can potentially collect that data in plain text and save it to NRDB. For example, Pixie gives insight into any data on your system, including raw HTTP requests in the kernel, allowing you to view all headers, query parameters, and HTTP bodies of a request.
New Relic, on the other hand, fetches and stores a subset of data that only revolves around an application's performance. These performance metrics include, but are not limited to: 
* Golden metrics (throughput, latency, error rate) for HTTP-based services
* HTTP transaction data
* Database transaction data (for MySQL & PostgreSQL)
* Distributed tracing
* JVM metrics


The data you view on the Live debugging tab comes via Pixie, and is therefore potentially sensitive. It will not be stored by New Relic and is ephemeral, queryable for only 24 hours. 
Control who has access to Pixie data
If you want to manage which members of your organization can view Pixie data, as well as install and delete Pixie links, you can [create a custom role](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#roles). Note that this option is available only to Enterprise and Pro level customers.
For more information, see [New Relic's user model](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/).
