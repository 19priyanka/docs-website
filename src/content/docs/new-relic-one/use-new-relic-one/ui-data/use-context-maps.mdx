title: Use context maps to understand your entity relationships
metaDescription: Context maps are available throughout the New Relic One UI to show how your entities relate to one another.
---

Context maps show how your entities are related to one another.

You'll be shown maps in various New Relic features to help you move quickly to assess, diagnose, and correct issues by giving your insight into how your complex software systems interrelate. The map's content and presentation vary depending on your use case, while some features are always available.

## Typical map view

The typical map view shows you entities, represented as hexagons, and their relationships, represented as lines with arrows indicating the call's direction.

        Primary entities that are the focus of the current map. 
        
        For example, the entities involved in an AIOps Issue or a Distributed Trace. If the entity is monitored by a New Relic agent, its language or type will be indicated by the icon inside the hexagon.

      <td>

## Health status

Where relevant, some maps add color to an entity to show its status. The maps use  the standard green, yellow, red, gray palette.

Distributed trace maps fill a primary entity's hexagon with a solid color to reflect its trace health context:
    
    * Red hexagons mean one or more span errors.
    * Orange hexagons mean one or more anomalous spans are detected.

## Map tooltip

Context maps show additional information about an entity, external, or datastore when you hover over its hexagon.

<figcaption>When you mouseover an entity on a context map, you'll see more information detail.</figcaption>

The map tooltip includes:

* the entity's name and type.
* any essential tags present on the entity.
* a preview of the entity's golden signals over the last 30 minutes.
* hexagons representing the Hosts this entity is running on, if known.
* other entities that have manually-created relationships to this entity.
* a button that opens the entity's mini-overview to gain deeper detail.
* a button to show all dependencies of the entity.
