title: Use context maps to understand your entity relationships
metaDescription: Context maps are available throughout the New Relic One UI to show how your entities relate to one another.
---

Context maps show the entities and relationships relevant to a particular context or issue.

Maps are shown in various New Relic features as appropriate to help more quickly assess, diagnose, and correct issues in complex software systems. The content and presentation of the map will vary by use case, while some features of the map are always available.

## Common map view

The context map shows entities, represented as hexagons, and relationships, represented as lines with arrows indicating call direction.

### Map legend

(I think this would work better as a table)
* Large, hollow hexagons represent the entities that are the primary focus of the current view. For example, the entities involved in an AIOps Issue or a Distributed Trace. If the entity is monitored by a New Relic agent, its language or type will be indicated by the icon inside the hexagon.
* Small, solid hexagons represent other New Relic-monitored entities that call or are called by the primary entities.
* Small cloud and database icons represent Externals and Datastores that are called by the primary entities.

## Health state

* Some map views color entities to reflect their alert status using the standard green, yellow, red, gray palette.
* Distributed trace maps fill a primary entity's hexagon with a solid color to reflect trace health context:
    * Red hexagons indicate an entity with one or more span errors
    * Orange hexagons indicate an entity where one or more anomalous spans are detected

## Map tooltip

Context maps show additional information about an entity or external/datastore when you hover over the hexagon.

**IMAGE 2 placeholder**

The map tooltip includes:
* the entity's name and type
* any Essential Tags present on the entity
* a preview of the entity's golden signals over the last 30 minutes
hexagons representing the Hosts this entity is running on, if known
other entities that have manually-created relationships to this entity
* a button that opens the entity's mini-overview to gain deeper detail
* a button to show all dependencies of the entity
