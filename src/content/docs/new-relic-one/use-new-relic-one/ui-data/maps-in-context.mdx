title: Maps in context help you understand entity relationships
metaDescription: Maps in context are available throughout the New Relic One UI to show how your entities relate to one another.
---

Maps show how your software entities are connected and deployed, using New Relic's auto-discovered and user-defined relationships for topology.

Various New Relic features, such as AIOps Issues and Distributed Tracing, include maps in context to help you quickly assess, diagnose, and correct issues by illustrating how your complex software systems are composed. The map's content and presentation vary depending on your use case, while some features are always available.

## Common map view

The typical map view shows you entities, represented as hexagons, and their relationships, represented as lines with arrows indicating call direction.

        Primary entities that are the focus of the current map. 
        
        For example, the entities involved in an AIOps Issue or a Distributed Trace. If the entity is monitored by a New Relic agent, its language or type will be indicated by the icon inside the hexagon.

## Health status

Where relevant, maps add color to an entity to show its alert status. The maps use the standard green, yellow, red, gray palette.

Distributed trace maps fill a primary entity's hexagon with a solid color to reflect health context from trace spans:
    
    * Red hexagons mean one or more span errors.
    * Orange hexagons mean one or more anomalous spans are detected.

## Map tooltip

Maps in context show additional information about an entity, external, or datastore when you hover over its hexagon.

The map tooltip includes:

* the entity's name and type.
* any essential tags present on the entity.
* a preview of the entity's golden signals over the last 30 minutes.
* hexagons representing the hosts this entity is running on, if known.
* other entities that have manually-created relationships to this entity.
* a button that opens the entity's mini-overview to gain deeper detail.
* a button to show all the entity's dependencies.
