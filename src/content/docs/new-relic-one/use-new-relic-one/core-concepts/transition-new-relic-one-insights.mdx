<Callout variant="important">
  As of March 22, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you.

This transition guide can help you understand:

* What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features
* Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One
* What to know and considerations when you make the switch
* How to get the most out of using New Relic One

## Steps for a successful transition [#switch]

The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (March 22, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021).

        We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of March 22, 2021, your old Insights web URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One.

        1. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide.
        2. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > More > Manage Data**. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.)

        Your Insights mobile app is deprecated as of March 22, 2021. 

        1. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store.
        2. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app.

      New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time.

        The Insights API to create dashboards will be deprecated and replaced with the new Dashboards API as of July 2021.

        1. Continue to use your Insights API key with the Dashboards API, or create a new API key.
        2. Start exploring the capabilities of the [Dashboards API in NerdGraph](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/dashboards-api-migration-insights-api-nerdgraph).

        The Insights Query REST API is not affected by this change and will not be deprecated.

        This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customersâ€™ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type.

## Improved features in New Relic One [#features]

New Relic One dashboards are an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more.

</figcaption>

Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. All of the dashboards you previously created in Insights are automatically available in New Relic One.

Features include:

* Better querying and charting experiences, including a ["basic" query mode](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-basic-mode-specify-data) that doesn't require knowledge of [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql)
* Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts, and a better [TV mode](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard#dash-visual-tv)
* More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit
* Easier creation of [dashboards with multiple pages](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/create-dashboards-have-multiple-pages) (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One.
* Improved experience for querying metric data, both the [`Metric` data type](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data) and [metric timeslice data](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql)
* Easy customization for your visualizations

## Recommendations

The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation:

<Callout variant="important">
  If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards.
</Callout>

If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include:

* Dashboards created using the [Insights metric explorer](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/metric-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents). When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights.
* Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One.
* New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts.

Also:

* Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called **Data apps**. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the **Data apps** section.
* Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following **Manage data** UI pages will remain in Insights for now:

  * **Summary** UI page
  * **Add data** UI page
  * **Embeddables** UI page
  * **Lookup tables** UI page
  * **API keys** UI page
  * **Formatter** UI page

  To find these pages: go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Manage data**
