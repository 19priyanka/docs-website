<Callout variant="important">
  As of April 11, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-insights-upgrade-to-nr1-dashboards/127823).
</Callout>

Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries and charts. Now we have [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), which has its own query builder experience. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience compared to Insights.

This transition guide can help you understand:

* What are some of the new and improved New Relic One chart/dashboard features
* Why it's easy to switch to New Relic One
* What to know and considerations when you make the switch
* How to get the most out of using New Relic One

## Improved features in New Relic One [#features]

New Relic One is an improvement to the Insights experience. New Relic One has all the dashboard and charting features that Insights has, and more.

</figcaption>

Switching to New Relic One is easy and seamless. After using your dashboards in New Relic One, your dashboards will still be in Insights.

Features include:

* Better querying and charting experiences, including a ["basic" query mode](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-basic-mode-specify-data) that doesn't require knowledge of [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql)
* Better display options that are easier to understand, especially with dense, line-heavy charts and a better [TV mode](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard#dash-visual-tv)
* More charts or widgets across dashboards (up to 12 now, instead of Insights' 3-across limit
* Easier creation of [dashboards with multiple pages](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/create-dashboards-have-multiple-pages) (previously called data apps in Insights). Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One.
* Improved experience for querying metric data, both the [`Metric` data type](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data) and [metric timeslice data](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql)
* Easy customization for your visualizations

## Try out New Relic One [#switch]

It's easy to try out and switch to New Relic One. We recommend reading the [recommendations](#recommendations) before you do. Then, to view your Insights dashboards in New Relic One, go to an Insights dashboard and click **Try new dashboards**.

## Recommendations

The transition from Insights to New Relic One was designed to be easy and seamless, but we have one recommendation:

<Callout variant="important">
  If your team starts to edit or create dashboards in New Relic One, don't go back to Insights to edit those dashboards.
</Callout>

If you create some types of dashboards in New Relic One, their improved features may lose functionality when edited in Insights. These include:

* Dashboards created using the [Insights metric explorer](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/explore-data/metric-explorer-search-chart-metrics-sent-new-relic-agents). When edited in New Relic One, that data is converted to another format, which means it cannot then be edited in Insights.
* Dashboards with 3+ widgets across. Insights has a 3-widgets-across limit. If you build a New Relic One dashboard with more than 3 widgets across, editing that dashboard in Insights will break its layout in New Relic One.
* New customization features result in incompatibilities between New Relic One and Insights charts.

Also:

* Dashboards with multiple pages are no longer called **Data apps**. When you create a New Relic One dashboard that has multiple pages and go back to Insights, it will be located in the **Data apps** section.
* Some admin-related UI pages are not present. The following **Manage data** UI pages will remain in Insights for now:

  * **Summary** UI page
  * **Add data** UI page
  * **Embeddables** UI page
  * **Lookup tables** UI page
  * **API keys** UI page
  * **Formatter** UI page

  To find these pages: go to **[insights.newrelic.com](https://insights.newrelic.com) > Manage data**
