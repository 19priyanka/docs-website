[New Relic's REST APIs](/docs/apis/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apis) let you retrieve data from, and push data to New Relic tools, and include configuration and delete capabilities. You can also use the [API Explorer](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer) to understand the data available to you via the REST API, to obtain curl commands, and to see JSON responses.

## Setup

To use the REST API you must [generate your API keys](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/api-keys#creating) from your account settings. You can then acquire data via the command line. The command structure follows this template:

```
curl  -X GET <URL> -H "X-api-key:${API_KEY}" -d '<PAYLOAD>'
```

The `GET` command could also be a `POST` or `DELETE`, depending on the query intent.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Our examples use curl as a common command line tool to pull metric timeslice data from the REST API. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. The `curl` commands include target URLs, header information, and data which are relevant for any request mechanism.
</Callout>

## URL

The API calls require a URL to specify the location from which the data will be accessed. You must replace the placeholder `<URL>` with the appropriate URL which will change depending on the type of data being requested. In general the URL follows this template:

```
https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json
```

The [$&#x7B;APPID}](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id) specifies the exact application or product for which the data is being requested. The information following this parameter will vary depending on the data request.

If you have an [EU region account](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center), the URL is:

```
api.eu.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can retrieve XML data instead of JSON by replacing `.json` with `.xml`.
</Callout>

## API key `${API_KEY}`

New Relic API calls require an [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/api-keys) in the call header. The API key uniquely identifies your account and authorizes access to your account data. New Relic borrows the placeholder $&#x7B;API_KEY} from Unix shell programming; be sure to replace $&#x7B;API_KEY} with an API key from your New Relic account.

## Query details (PAYLOAD)

The &lt;PAYLOAD> contains the query details, which define:

* The metric name you want to query and the value you want to retrieve
* The defined [time range](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/specifying-time-range-v2) for retrieving metrics
* (Optional): The average of the metric timeslice data by using [summarize](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/calculating-average-metric-values-summarize)

## Examples

See the following documents for example API use cases:

* [APM examples](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2) (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from New Relic APM)
* [Browser examples](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/browser-examples-v2) (how to retrieve metric timeslice data from New Relic Browser)
* [Labels examples](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/labels-examples-v2) (how to retrieve information about your labels and categories for apps)
* [Plugin examples](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/plugin-examples-v2/) (how to retrieve information and metric timeslice data about plugins from New Relic Plugin Central)
* [Alerts examples](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/rest-api-alerts) (create alert conditions and configure notification channels, and more)
