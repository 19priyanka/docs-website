New Relic stores the list of individuals who can use your account in a database by their [email address](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users), assigned [role](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/users-roles), and their first and last name if provided. You can view this data from New Relic's [user interface](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users) and from the [API Explorer (v2)](/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/parts-api-explorer).

When using these examples, replace the `${API_KEY}` placeholder with your [REST API key or Admin's API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key#viewing).

<Callout variant="tip">
  To obtain the same information from the [New Relic API Explorer (v2)](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore), select **Users > GET List**, and include your [REST API key or Admin's API key](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/api-key#viewing).

## Listing all account users

To obtain a list of all users for your account, use this command:

```
curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/users.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i
```

The output will appear similar to this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 123456,
      "first_name": "My",
      "last_name": "Name",
      "email": "my.name@mywebsite.com",
      "role": "owner"
    },
    {
      "id": 654321,
      "first_name": "Adam",
      "last_name": "Admin",
      "email": "adam.admin@mywebsite.com",
      "role": "admin"
    },
    },
    {
      "id": 345123,
      "first_name": "Any",
      "last_name": "User",
      "email": "any.user@mywebsite.com",
      "role": "user"
    },
    ...
```

## Listing by user email

If you know all or part of the user's email, you can use this command to return the role, name, and user `id`. The `filter[email]=` clause specifies the known part of the email (for example, `"my.name"`).

**Note:** Character matching is a simple string. No regular expression capability is available, so multiple matches may occur if the selected string is not unique.

```
curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/users.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i \
     -d 'filter[email]=my.name'
```

The output for this command will be the same as the first entry in the [Listing all account users](#list_all_users) example.

## Listing by user `id`

If you know the user `id`, you can use this command to return the role, name, and email. The `filter[ids]=` clause specifies the user `id`.

```
curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/users.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i \
     -d 'filter[ids]=123456'
```

You can also use this command, which embeds the user `id` in the URL and omits the filter.

```
curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/users/123456.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i
```

The output for this command will be the same as the first entry in the [Listing all account users](#list_all_users) example.
