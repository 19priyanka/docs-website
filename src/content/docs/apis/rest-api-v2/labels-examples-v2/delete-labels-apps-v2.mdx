<Callout variant="tip">
  Use New Relic One to unify the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. For more information, see the [tagging UI documentation](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and the [NerdGraph tagging API tutorial](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/nerdgraph-graphiql-tagging-api-tutorial).
</Callout>

To delete [labels](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers) from your apps using the New Relic REST API, substitute your account's [REST API key or Admin user's API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key) for `${API_KEY}` in this example.

## Delete labels

<Callout variant="caution">
  This API call will remove **all** instances of the label from both applications and hosts. If you want to remove a label from a specific application or host, you must use the [New Relic user interface](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers).
</Callout>

Use a command similar to the following example to delete a label from your account.

```
curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/labels/Production:Main.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i
```

You can also use the New Relic REST API Explorer (v2) to [delete labels](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/labels/delete).

## View the output

The output for deleting a label will appear similar to the following example for a single application. This example will delete the label `Production:Main` from all locations where it was applied for the account's [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key).

The output for deleting labels includes:

* The full key name for the label (for example, `Production:Main`), as well as the component and name for the key
* The application `health_status` (red, orange, green, gray) and the IDs for the label in each category; for example, the health status for app ID 546917 is green (the app is fine)
* Apps that have this label; for example, the label `Production:Main` has been removed from one application (546917)

```
{
  "label": {
    "key": "Production:Main",
    "category": "Production",
    "name": "Main",
    "application_health_status": {
      "green": [
        546917
      ],
      "orange": [],
      "red": [],
      "gray": []
    },
    "links": {
      "applications": [
        546917
      ],
    }
  },
  ....
}
```

## Review return status

There are two possible return statuses when deleting labels:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Return status**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Definition**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        200 OK
      </td>

      <td>
        An attempt to delete a label was successful.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        404 Not Modified
      </td>

      <td>
        An attempt was made to delete a non-existent label.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>
