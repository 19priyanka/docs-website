<Callout variant="tip">
  Use New Relic One to unify the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. For more information, see the [tagging UI documentation](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and the [NerdGraph tagging API tutorial](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/nerdgraph-graphiql-tagging-api-tutorial).
</Callout>

To use these examples, list the [labels](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers) available in your account and replace `${API_KEY}` with the [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key) associated with the account. You can also use the New Relic REST API Explorer (v2) to [list label values](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/labels/list).

## List existing labels

To list the labels that exist in your account, use this command:

```
curl 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/labels.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i
```

## View the output

The output for the label includes:

* The full key name for the label (for example, `Staging:Test1`), as well as the component and name for the key
* The application `health_status` (red, orange, green, gray) and application IDs for the label in each category
* Apps that have this label; for example, the label `Staging:Test1` has been applied to one application (4937390) and two hosts (3801143 and 5879721)

The output for a label listing will appear similar to this:

```
{
  "labels": [
    {
      "key": "Production:Main",
      "category": "Production",
      "name": "Main",
      "application_health_status": {
        "green": [],
        "orange": [],
        "red": [],
        "gray": []
      },
      "links": {
        "applications": [],
      }
    },
    {
      "key": "Staging:Test1",
      "category": "Staging",
      "name": "Test1",
      "application_health_status": {
        "green": [],
        "orange": [],
        "red": [
          4937390
        ],
        "gray": []
      },
      "links": {
        "applications": [
          4937390
        ],
      }
    },
...
}
```
