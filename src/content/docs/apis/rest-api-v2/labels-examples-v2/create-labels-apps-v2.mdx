<Callout variant="tip">
  Use New Relic One to unify the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. For more information, see the [tagging UI documentation](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/tagging-use-tags-organize-group-what-you-monitor) and the [NerdGraph tagging API tutorial](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/nerdgraph-graphiql-tagging-api-tutorial).
</Callout>

You can create or apply [labels](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/labels-categories-organizing-your-apps-servers) to the applications in your account. You can also use the New Relic REST API Explorer (v2) to [create labels](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/labels/create).

## Requirements

Creating or applying a label requires:

* The [$&#x7B;API_KEY}](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/api-keys) for your account must be an Admin User's API key.
* The label must be applied to an existing [application ID](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/listing-your-app-id-metric-data-v2).
* The label must conform to the [Guidelines for category labels](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/organize-your-data/labels-categories-organize-apps-servers-monitors#guidelines).

## Create or apply labels

Use a command similar to the following example to apply a label to an application that exists in your account. Substitute your account's [REST API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key) for `${API_KEY}` and the [application id](/docs/apm/apis/requirements/identification-code) in the location noted in the example.

You can use this command to apply the same label to applications and hosts simultaneously. You can also omit the `"applications":` section if not needed.

```
curl -X PUT 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/labels.json' \
     -H "X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}" -i \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d \
'{
  "label": {
    "category": "Production",
    "name": "Web01",
    "links": {
      "applications": [
        123456,7898765     <---<< application ids
      ],
    }
  }
}'
```

## View the output

The output for creating or applying a label will appear similar to the following example for a single application. The label output includes:

* The full key name for the label (for example, `Production:Main`), as well as the component and name for the key
* The application `health_status` (red, orange, green, gray) and the application IDs for the label in each category; for example, the health status for app ID 546917 is green (the app is fine)
* Apps that have this label; for example, the label `Production:Main` has been applied to one application (546917)

```
{
  "label": {
    "key": "Production:Main",
    "category": "Production",
    "name": "Main",
    "application_health_status": {
      "green": [
        546917        <---application id
      ],
      "orange": [],
      "red": [],
      "gray": []
    },
    "links": {
      "applications": [
        546917        <--- application id
      ],
    }
  },
...
}
```

## Review return status

There are two possible return statuses when creating labels:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        Return status
      </th>

      <th>
        Definition
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        201 Create
      </td>

      <td>
        A label was successfully created.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        304 Not Modified
      </td>

      <td>
        There was an attempt to re-create an existing label, but no change was needed or made.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>
