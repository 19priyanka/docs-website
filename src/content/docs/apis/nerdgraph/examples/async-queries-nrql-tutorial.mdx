metaDescription: Use New Relic NerdGraph to make asynchronous NRQL queries that have longer query duration limits.
---

If you want to run NRQL queries that have a 10-minute [query duration limit](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/rate-limits-nrql-queries), you can use [our NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to run an asynchronous query. This is useful for queries of a large data set or that query over a long time range. It can also be useful for running queries that have less risk of being interrupted by browser or HTTP connection timeout limits or other issues. 

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requires [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-plus). 

## Asynchronous query example [#example]

Here's an example of an asynchronous query NerdGraph call. The `async: true` is what makes the query asynchronous. This query will return results if it completes within the default timeout of 5 seconds; otherwise it will return queryProgress data for use in follow-up queries to the `actor.account.nrqlQueryProgress` field. 

```
{
   actor {
      account(id: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>) {
         nrql(query: <var>"SELECT * FROM Transaction"</var>, async: true) {
            results
               queryProgress {
               queryId
               completed
               retryAfter
               retryDeadline
               resultExpiration
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

## Getting the results or status of an async query [#example-query-results]

When you run the previous query, it will return a query ID, which you can use to get results or progress status for that query. 

```
{
   actor {
      account(id: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>) {
         nrqlQueryProgress(queryId: "<var>YOUR_QUERY_ID</var>") {
            results
            queryProgress {
               queryId
               completed
               retryAfter
               retryDeadline
               resultExpiration
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
```

Some important details about this query: 

* The `queryId` comes from the `queryProgress` data returned by the original asynchronous query.
* The `account` argument must match the `account` argument from the original query.
* This query will return results if asynchronous execution has completed; otherwise it will return `queryProgress` data.
* The query can be repeated verbatim until results or an error are returned.
