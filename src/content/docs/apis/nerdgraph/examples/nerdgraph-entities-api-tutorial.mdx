To query data with the [New Relic NerdGraph](/docs/introduction-new-relic-graphql), we use the concept of an `entity`. An entity provides unified access to all the things you monitor with New Relic, including but not limited to:

* Applications monitored by [New Relic APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm)
* Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by [New Relic infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/get-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure)

To view entity details in the New Relic UI, use the [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer) in [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).

## Entity definition [#definition]

Each [entity](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) has similar traits:

* A unique entity GUID identifies it.
* It exists over a span of time, even if it is a short period.
* It provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for exploring data related to other entities.

## Requirements

The only thing you need is a [user key](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key).

## Search for entities [#search-entity]

New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID.

You can craft a query in one of two ways:

* Use the `queryBuilder` argument to help you craft a query.

  OR
* Use the freeform `query` argument to provide your own search.

For example, to use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID. In addition to [these examples](#graphql-examples), we highly recommend exploring the API using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and searching its inline documentation.

### Search by attribute [#search-attribute]

1. Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at [https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example:

   ```
   query($query: <mark>String!</mark>) {
     actor {
       entitySearch(query: $query) {
         count
         results {
           entities {
             name
             entityType
             guid
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Add the following [variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) to the **Query variables** section in NerdGraph:

   ```
   {"query": "name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND type IN ('APPLICATION')"}
   ```

### Search by entity GUID [#search-guid]

1. Use a specific entity's GUID to query deeper into its related data. For example:

   ```
   query($guids: <mark>EntityGuid!</mark>) {
     actor {
       entities(guids: $guids) {
         entityType
         name
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Add the following [variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) to the **Query variables** section:

   ```
   {"guids": "entity-guid-here"}
   ```

## Example queries [#graphql-examples]

Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema.

Entities in NerdGraph rely on [GraphQL interfaces](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api#terminology), a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples.

    If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, you can rely on NerdGraph to help you build one, and then retrieve entity data and the query string that was built.

    * Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the `queryBuilder` argument.
    * You cannot use the `query` and `queryBuilder` arguments at the same time.
    * We highly recommend exploring the API using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(<mark>queryBuilder</mark>: {type: APPLICATION}) {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              reporting
              ... on AlertableEntityOutline {
                alertSeverity
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  <Collapser
    id="infrastructure-entities"
    title="Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results"
  >
    There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the `infrastructureIntegrationType` input argument to explore them.

    * You cannot use the `query` and `queryBuilder` arguments at the same time.
    * Use `infrastructureIntegrationType` in place of the `type` input argument.
    * We highly recommend exploring the API using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(queryBuilder: {<mark>infrastructureIntegrationType</mark>: F5_NODE}) {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              entityType
              domain
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  <Collapser
    id="alert-info"
    title="Get alert information on alertable entities in search results"
  >
    You can fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by New Relic Alerts. This NerdGraph query will tell you if New Relic is currently receiving data from your application (using the `reporting` field).

    * If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity.
    * If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the `AlertableEntityOutline` fields.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerdgraph'") {
          results {
            entities {
              reporting
              ... on AlertableEntityOutline {
                alertSeverity
              }
            }

  <Collapser
    id="apm-summary"

    Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities; more summary data can be requested in your query. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerdgraph'") {
          results {
            entities {
              name
              ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline {
                apmSummary {
                  errorRate
                  apdexScore

  <Collapser
    id="search-entity"
    title="Get data specific to each entity type in search results"

    Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities. If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerdgraph'") {
          results {
            entities {

                }
              }
              ... on BrowserApplicationEntityOutline {
                browserSummary {
                  jsErrorRate
                }

  <Collapser
    id="tags-entity"

    This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the [NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/graphql-tagging-api-tutorial).

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like '<var>nerdgraph</var>'") {
          results {
            entities {
              name
              <mark>tags</mark> {
                <mark>key</mark>
                <mark>values</mark>
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="get-nextcursor"
    title="Get the nextCursor for paginated search results"
  >
    The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search. If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request `nextCursor` in your initial request and use its value in another query to retrieve the following "page" of results. If there are no more results, `nextCursor` will be null.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like '<var>nerd-graph</var>'") {
          results {
            <mark>nextCursor</mark>
            entities {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Use the value of `nextCursor` in your next search:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerd-graph'") {
          results(cursor: "<var>next_cursor_value</var>") {
            <mark>nextCursor</mark>
            entities {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Golden metrics and golden tags [#golden]

"Golden metrics" and "golden tags" are bits of information about an entity that we considered are the most important for that entity. We use this information to display a brief overview of an entity across all New Relic.

### Fetch golden metrics [#golden-metrics]

When fetching golden metrics for a specific GUID or list of GUIDS, the provided queries will be already filtered for you. You can run the resulting query as is in the query builder. The resulting metric can be either a timeseries or a single value.

Here is an example of one golden metric query for an AWS DynamoDB table entity with GUID `ExampleGUID`.

```
SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)
FROM DatastoreSample
WHERE entityGuid IN ('ExampleGUID') AND provider='DynamoDbTable'
TIMESERIES
```

You can use NerdGraph to query for the golden metrics of a specific entity; for example:

```
{
  actor {
    entity(guid: "<var>ENTITY-GUID</var>") {
      goldenMetrics {
        query
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also fetch the golden metrics for a specific domain and type; for example, `APM APPLICATION`. In this case the query is always a timeseries and is faceted by the entity name.

You don't receive a final query because we don't know on which entities the query will apply. We provide a query template so you can fill the missing information.

Here is the same example as before for AWS DynamoDB table where the domain is `INFRA` and the type is `AWSDYNAMODBTABLE`.

```
SELECT average(provider.getSuccessfulRequestLatency.Average)
FROM DatastoreSample
WHERE entityGuid IN (<var>ENTITY_GUIDS</var>) AND provider='DynamoDbTable'
FACET entityName TIMESERIES
```

Replace `(ENTITY_GUIDS)` with the list of GUIDS you want for the metric you want to display. You can also use `(DOMAIN_IDS)` with this template.

The query using NerdGraph looks like this:/p>

```
{
  actor {
    entityTypes(domainTypes: {domain: "INFRA", type: "AWSDYNAMODBTABLE"}) {
      goldenMetrics {
        title
        query
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fetch golden tags [#golden-tags]

Golden tags are always represented the same way, whether requested by `GUID` or by `entityType`. You will always receive the list of tag keys considered the most importance on the entity.

```
{
  actor {
    entityTypes(domainTypes: {domain: "INFRA", type: "AWSDYNAMODBTABLE"}) {
      goldenTags {
        key
      }
    }
  }
}
```
