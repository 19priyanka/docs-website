With [NerdGraph](/docs/introduction-new-relic-graphql), you can query details about your monitored entities. 

<Callout variant="important">
  To work with an entity's golden metrics and tags, see the golden metrics [API tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/golden-metrics-entities-nerdgraph-api-tutorial).

## Entity definition [#definition]

Entities are an important New Relic concept. Basically, an entity is anything we monitor, including but not limited to: 

* Applications monitored by [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm).
* Cloud integrations, services, and hosts monitored by our [infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/get-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure).

[Learn more about how we define "entity."](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic)

To view entity details in the UI, you can use the [Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer).

When working with entities in NerdGraph, it can help to understand some important traits they have:

* A unique entity GUID identifies an entity.
* An entity exists over a span of time, even if it's a short period.
* An entity provides a useful entry point for exploring data about specific metrics and events, or for contextualizing data related to other entities.

## Requirements [#requirements]

You need a [user key](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/understand-new-relic-api-keys#user-api-key).

## Search for entities [#search-entity]

New Relic searches for entities by their attributes, primarily their name, but also by type of entity and other values. The search returns basic data about entities matching the search criteria. Then, from the basic query results, you can query a specific entity by its GUID.

Common attributes to all entities regardless of `domainType`:

* `id`
* `accountId`
* `name`
* `domainId`
* `alertSeverity`
* `reporting`

You can filter by any of the above attributes. Additionally, you can use [tags]/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial/#add-tags) for filtering too. 

<Callout variant="caution">
  You cannot filter by custom, root-level entity properties. Custom properties are only retrieved as part of the entityâ€™s metadata in the actual search response. To filter by a custom field, transform it into an entity tag.
</Callout>

You can craft a query in one of two ways:

* Use the `queryBuilder` argument to help you craft a query.

  OR
* Use the freeform `query` argument to provide your own search.

To use NerdGraph to query one or more entities, you can search by attribute or GUID.

In addition to [these examples](#graphql-examples), we highly recommend exploring the API using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and searching its inline documentation.

### Search with `queryBuilder` [#search-querybuilder]

The `queryBuilder` argument is useful to construct simple queries, it allows you to add filters to your query from a predefined list of attributes, and their typical values. For more advanced queries, use the `query` argument instead.

1. Go to the NerdGraph [GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(<mark>queryBuilder</mark>: {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              name
              entityType
              guid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Search with freeform `query` [#search-query]

Useful to craft more complex queries.

1. Go to the NerdGraph [GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).
2. Run a basic query to find entities that match your search criteria. For example:

   ```
   query($query: <mark>String!</mark>) {
     actor {
       entitySearch(query: $query) {
         count
         results {
           entities {
             name
             entityType
             guid
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
3. Add the following [variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables) to the **Query variables** section in NerdGraph:

   ```
   {"query": "name LIKE 'nerd-graph' AND domainType IN ('APM-APPLICATION')"}
   ```

## Fetch entities by GUID [#fetch-by-guid]

When you know the GUID of the entity you want to fetch, you can just use the `entity` attribute:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entity(guid: "MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3") {
          name
          entityType
        }
      }
    }
    ```

This can also be written as a search query:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "id = 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3'") {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              name
              entityType
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Or, to fetch multiple entities at the same time, you can use the `entities` attribute:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entities(guids: ["MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3", "MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3"]) {
          name
          entityType
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Likewise, as a search query:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "id in ('MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0Mjk3', 'MTAwNDc5MzZ8QVBNfEFQUExJQ0FUSU9OfDExNzA0MTM3')") {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              name
              entityType
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Example queries [#graphql-examples]

Queries are requests that are intended to only fetch data (no side effects). NerdGraph queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more or less data depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema.

Entities in NerdGraph rely on [GraphQL interfaces](/docs/apis/graphql-api/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-graphql-api#terminology), a concept that allows objects to share common fields. Interfaces are used to provide data for specific entity types, as you will see in many of these NerdGraph query examples.

    If you aren't sure how to start crafting an entity search query, you can rely on NerdGraph to help you build one, and then retrieve entity data and the query string that was built.

    * Request the query field in your results to see the query string built by the `queryBuilder` argument.
    * You cannot use the `query` and `queryBuilder` arguments at the same time.
    * We highly recommend exploring the API using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(<mark>queryBuilder</mark>: {domain: APM, type: APPLICATION}) {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              reporting
              ... on AlertableEntityOutline {
                alertSeverity
              }
            }
          }

  <Collapser
    id="infrastructure-entities"
    title="Get data for infrastructure integration entities in search results"
  >
    There are many different types of Infrastructure integration entities and they are listed separately from other entity types. Use the `infrastructureIntegrationType` input argument to explore them.

    * You cannot use the `query` and `queryBuilder` arguments at the same time.
    * Use `infrastructureIntegrationType` in place of the `type` input argument.
    * We highly recommend exploring the API using the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) and searching its inline documentation to see the query options available to you.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(queryBuilder: {<mark>infrastructureIntegrationType</mark>: F5_NODE}) {
          query
          results {
            entities {
              entityType

  <Collapser
    id="alert-info"
    title="Get alert information on alertable entities in search results"
  >
    Fetch the alert severity of any entity that can be monitored by [New Relic's Alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts). This NerdGraph query will tell you if we are currently receiving data from your application (using the `reporting` field).

    * If the entity is an alertable type, results will include the alert severity of the entity.
    * If the results include entities that are not alertable, they will not include the `AlertableEntityOutline` fields.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerdgraph' and alertSeverity is not null") {
          results {
            entities {
              reporting
              ... on AlertableEntityOutline {
                alertSeverity
              }

    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="apm-summary"

    Different entity types have specific data associated with them. The following NerdGraph query example shows a selection of fields available for APM application entities:

    * More summary data can be requested in your query.
    * If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include these fields.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerdgraph' and domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'") {
          results {
            entities {
              name
              ... on ApmApplicationEntityOutline {

    Different entity types have specific data associated with them. This NerdGraph query example requests the name for all entities regardless of which entity type they are, as well as the error rate for APM, browser monitoring, and mobile entities.

    * If entities of other types are returned in your search results, they will not include an error rate field.

    ```
    {

    This NerdGraph query example fetches tags for every entity returned in the search results. For more information, see the [NerdGraph GraphiQL tagging tutorial](/docs/apis/graphql-api/tutorials/graphql-tagging-api-tutorial).

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like '<var>nerdgraph</var>'") {
          results {
            entities {

              <mark>tags</mark> {
                <mark>key</mark>
                <mark>values</mark>
              }

  <Collapser
    id="tags-filter"
    title="Use tags to filter entity results"
  >
    This NerdGraph query example filters entities that belong to the `INFRA` domain and belong to awsRegion `us-east-1`, and returns their name in the search results. 

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "domain = 'INFRA' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'") {
          results {
            entities {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Additionally, filtering can be done by whether a given tag is present; the following query filters entities of the domainType `BROWSER-APPLICATION` and have the tag `clusterAgentId` defined.
    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "domainType = 'BROWSER-APPLICATION' and tags.clusterAgentId is not null") {
          results {
            entities {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  <Collapser
    id="tags-filter"
    title="Aggregate results by an attribute or a tag"
  >
    This NerdGraph query example filters entities of domainType `APM-APPLICATION` domain that belong to awsRegion `us-east-1`, and returns their name in the search results. Then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by New Relic account id.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION'") {
          facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {facet: ACCOUNT_ID}}) {
            counts {
              count
              facet
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Additionally, aggregation can be done by tags too; the following query filters entities of domainType `APM-APPLICATION` domain that belong to awsRegion `us-east-1`, then aggregates results to get the total number of entities grouped by Agent language.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "domainType = 'APM-APPLICATION' and tags.aws.awsRegion = 'us-east-1'") {
          facetedCounts(facets: {facetCriterion: {tag: "language"}}) {
            counts {
              count
              facet
            }
          }
        }

  <Collapser
    id="get-nextcursor"
    title="Get the nextCursor for paginated search results"
  >
    The NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer paginates results from an entity search.

    * If your search criteria yields more than the API limit and you want to view the rest of the results, you can request `nextCursor` in your initial request and use its value in another query to retrieve the following "page" of results.
    * If there are no more results, `nextCursor` will be null.

    ```
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like '<var>nerd-graph</var>'") {
          results {
            <mark>nextCursor</mark>
            entities {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Use the value of `nextCursor` in your next search:

    ```graphql
    {
      actor {
        entitySearch(query: "name like 'nerd-graph'") {
          results(cursor: "<var>next_cursor_value</var>") {
            <mark>nextCursor</mark>
            entities {
              name
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Delete entities [#delete-entities]

You can manually delete any entity in your account by using the NerdGraph API. To do so, run this query with the entity's GUID in the [NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql):

```
mutation {
  entityDelete(guids: ["EntityGuid"]) {
    deletedEntities
    failures
  }
}

```

<Callout variant="important">
  Currently, you can only remove the following [entity types](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic) using the Nerdgraph API: `APM-APPLICATION`, `EXT-SERVICE`, and `REF-REPOSITORY`.

  You may see a deleted entity in your UI if a New Relic agent reindexes it again.
</Callout>
