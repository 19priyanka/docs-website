<Callout title="BETA FEATURE">
This feature is currently in [beta](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/).
</Callout>

Alternatively to using the UI to [create](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/service-level-management/create-slm) and [consume](https://docs-preview.newrelic.com/docs/service-level-management/consume-slm) Service Levels, you can also use the [NerdGraph API Explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) to automate the configuration of SLIs and SLOs. 

<Callout variant="important">
  In order to create Service Levels you need [a role with permissions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/) to modify and delete metric rules. 
</Callout>

Use the mutation `serviceLevelCreate` to create Service Levels. It contains these fields:

* **`entityGuid`**: The GUID of the entity (for example, APM service, browser application, etc.) that you want to relate this SLI to. The SLI/SLO results will appear within the UI of any workload that contains the entity.
* **`description`**: The description of the SLI. Use the descriptions we provide, and include the selected threshold that determines good events. 
* **`accountId`**: The ID of the account where the APM service or browser application belongs to, which contains the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations. 
* **`badEvents.from`**, **`badEvents.where`**: Please check the previous sections. If you defined an SLI from valid and bad events, leave the `goodEvents` object empty. 
* **`goodEvents.from`**, **`goodEvents.where`**: Please check the previous sections. If you defined an SLI from valid and good events, leave the `badEvents` object empty. 
* **`validEvents.from`**, **`validEvents.where`**: See the previous sections.
* **`name`**: A short category name for your SLI to help understand what the Service Level is about. Examples: 
  * Availability
  * Latency below 4 seconds
  * CLS for desktops below 0.1   
* **`objectives`**: An array of objectives (SLOs) for the SLI.
  * `target`: The target for your SLO, up to 100.00. 
    * If your users are happy with the current experience, set the SLO percentage to match the percentile that you used to determine the SLI's good events (for example 95.00%). 
    * If you believe your users are NOT happy with their current experience, you can set a slightly lower target, closer to the actual performance of your APM service or browser app. Youâ€™ll probably burn all your error budget by the end of the period, but period over period you`ll work towards reaching that aspirational target.  
  * `timeWindow.rolling.count`: The length of the period taken into consideration to calculate the SLO. The supported values are `1`, `7`, `14`, `28`, and `30`. 
  * `timeWindow.rolling.unit`: `DAY`is the supported value.

### Retrieve and query Service Levels [#retrieve-sl] 

Use the `actor.entity endpoint` to retrieve the SLI/SLO configuration and resulting queries. 

Remember that API queries:

* Require the service or browser app GUID, which you can find on the entity page, under **See metadata and manage tags**.
* Need the `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses, and the SLI description.
