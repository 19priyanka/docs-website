You can use NerdGraph to view your organization’s accounts, create accounts, and rename accounts. 

## Requirements [#requirements]

Requirements include: 
* Requires [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard edition organizations can only have one account). 
* You must be a user on the New Relic One user model ([learn more](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models#determine-user-model)). Other permissions-related requirements: 
  * Required [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): either core user or full platform user 
  * Required [role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#roles): either **Organization manager** or **Authentication domain manager**

## Important concepts [#concepts]

Before creating or renaming accounts, be sure you understand [the concept of an account and what it’s used for](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

Some notes on fields used in these requests: 
* The `administrableAccounts` field is simply a term for the accounts in an organization. It is synonymous with "accounts."
* The `regionCode` field refers to [the data center used by an account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/choose-your-data-center): `US` or `EU`. Note that an organization can only use a single data center: there can't be accounts that use diffrent data centers in a single organization.

## View accounts [#view-accounts]

Here’s an example of returning the accounts in your organization: 

```
{
  actor {
    organization {
      administrableAccounts {
        id
        name
        regionCode
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Create accounts [#create-accounts]

Here’s an example of how to create an account. Before creating an account, make sure you understand [what an account is used for](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure). 

```
mutation {
  administrableAccountsCreateAccount(administrableAccount: {name: "acme_dev"}) {
    administrableAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

## Rename an account [#rename-accounts]

Here’s an example of how to rename an account. 

```
mutation {
  administrableAccountsUpdateAccount(administrableAccount: {id: 111, name: ""}) {
    administrableAccount {
      id
      name
      regionCode
    }
  }
}
```

## Errors [#errors]

Here are some errors and what they mean: 

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th className="fcenter">
            **Error message**
          </th>

          <th className="fcenter">
            **Likely cause**
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
```"unauthorized", {
      extensions: { nerdGraphExtensions: { errorClass: "ACCESS_DENIED" } }
    }
```
</td>

<td>
This points to a problem with your organization structure (for example, an account that is somehow outside the boundaries of an organization). If you get this message, talk to your account representative or [support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal). 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>
```
cannot create subaccount -- multiple parent account ids found. Please use Partnership API.", {
        extensions: { nerdGraphExtensions: { errorClass: "SERVER_ERROR" } }
      }
```
          </td>

          <td>
This is a message returned when your organization has more than one "parent account," which is an indicator that your organization has a complex account structure that was set up with the [Partnership API](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partner-api) and requires the use of that API. Have questions? Talk to your account representative or [support](/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/find-help-use-support-portal).  
</td>
        </tr>
