## How to query data partitions rules


The following  NerdGraph API request  example retrieves all data partition rules for a given account. 

```
{
  actor {
  account(id: 123456) {
			logsConfiguration {
			  dataPartitionRules { 
						id 
						targetDataPartition
					  description
					  matchingCriteria {
							  attributeName
							  matchingOperator
							  matchingExpression
															}
														}
													}
												}
					}
	}
```
## Data partition rule schema

In the example above only a few fields are requested. Here is the complete list of the possible fields for a data partition rule: 

<table>

      </th>
      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
<tr><td>id </td><td> Unique data partition rule identifier.</td></tr>
<tr><td>targetDataPartition</td><td>The name of the data partition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>description	</td> <td>A description of what this data partition rule represents.</td></tr>
<tr><td>matchingCriteria</td> <td>The matching criteria for this data partition rule. Logs matching this criteria will be routed to the specified data partition once the rule is enabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>retentionPolicy</td> <td>The retention policy of the data partition data.</td></tr>
<tr><td>createdAt</td> <td> Identifies the date and time when the rule was created.</td></tr>
<tr><td>createdBy</td> <td> Identifies the user who has created the rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>updatedAt</td> <td> Whether or not this data partition rule is enabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>updatedBy</td> <td> Identifies the user who has last updated the rule.</td></tr>
<tr><td>enabled</td> <td> Whether or not this data partition rule is enabled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>deleted</td> <td> Whether or not this data partition rule is deleted. Deleting a data partition rule does not delete the already</td></tr>

Before creating the rule please be sure to check this article: [Organize data with partitions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/data-partitions/) and make sure the **targetDataPartition** name startsDeleting a data partition rule does not delete the already persisted data. This data will be retained for a given period of time specified in the retention policy field.

```
mutation {
	logsConfigurationCreateDataPartitionRule(
	  accountId: 1123456,
    rule: {
      targetDataPartition: "Log_aNewDataPartitionRule",
      description: "Example data partition rule",
      matchingCriteria: {
        attributeName: "attribute",
        matchingMethod: LIKE,
        matchingExpression: "'%example%'"
      },
      retentionPolicy: STANDARD,
      enabled: true
    }) {
   	rule {
      id
      targetDataPartition
      description
    }
    errors {
      message
      type
    }
  }
}
```

## How to delete data partitions rules

```
mutation {
logsConfigurationDeleteDataPartitionRule(id: "1111", accountId: 123456) {
    errors {
      message
