## Problem [#problem]

After running a discovery, you are seeing `Kentik Default` entities in the New Relic UI

## Solutions [#solutions]

During discovery, `ktranslate` collects the [System Object Identifier](http://oid-info.com/get/1.3.6.1.2.1.1.2) (i.e.; sysObjectID, or sysOID). As defined, this OID *"provides an easy and unambiguous means for determining `what kind of box' is being managed..."*. Which essentially means that every device type that responds to SNMP will have a sysObjectID, and the value of that ID should be unique enough to allow anyone to identify which type of device they are looking at.

<Callout variant="tip">
A great example of this can be seen in the [CISCO-PRODUCTS-MIB](https://mibs.observium.org/mib/CISCO-PRODUCTS-MIB/), which outlines the sysObjectID values for a large number of the various devices Cisco has supported over the years.
</Callout>

Once `ktranslate` is aware of the sysObjectID for a device, it will use that value to match against the known profiles available in the open source [snmp-profiles](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles) repository that Kentik maintains. 

If the sysObjectID cannot be matched, then the device will be considered a `Kentik Default` entity. The purpose of this is to provide visualization for users that devices are being monitored, as well as direction on how to help drive a better experience for their specific device(s).

### Device type already exists

In many situations, there is a pre-existing profile that will cover your device that we simply need to add the new sysObjectID to. The first step is to take a look in the [snmp-profiles](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/tree/main/profiles/kentik_snmp) repository to see if there is a directory for your device's vendor, and associated profile file within the directory.

For example, if you have a Cisco Catalyst series switch that is showing up as a `Kentik Default`, but the sysObjectID is not on the [catalyst profile](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/blob/main/profiles/kentik_snmp/cisco/cisco-catalyst.yml), then you can either create a pull request to have it added, or open an issue on the repository and we will get it added on your behalf.

### New device type needed

Alternatively, if there is not a current profile that you can find that would meet your needs, you would want to [open an issue](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/issues/new/choose) on the GitHub repository requesting a new SNMP profile. Please take note that we will need a sanitized output from an [SNMP walk](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-walk) on your device to create the profile.
