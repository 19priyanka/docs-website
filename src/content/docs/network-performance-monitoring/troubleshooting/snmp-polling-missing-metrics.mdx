## Problem [#problem]

During SNMP monitoring, you are not seeing all of the expected metrics for your device.

## Solutions [#solutions]

While there are various situations that may fall into this category, they all start with the same step for troubleshooting; identify what metrics exist right now in New Relic so you have an understanding of next steps.

Example NRQL (replace `$DEVICE_NAME` with the name of your device):

```
FROM Metric SELECT 
uniques(metricName) 
WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'kentik' 
AND device_name = '$DEVICE_NAME'
SINCE 1 HOUR AGO LIMIT MAX
```

This will give you a list of every dimensional metric being collected on your device in the last hour. If the metric is not listed, you should try the following:

### Verify the device responds to target OID

Using the [snmpwalk utility](/docs/network-performance-monitoring/setup-performance-monitoring/snmp-walk), try and gather the metric from the Docker host using the SNMP credentials you have configured in the `snmp-base.yaml` configuration file.

If the test fails, the device most likely does not support the OID yuo would like to collect. This is a limitation of the device itself, as controlled by the vendor.

<Callout variant="tip">
If you are using SNMP v3, you'll want to validate the configuration of the v3 user on the device. In most situations, device administrators need to explicitly grant access to MIBs for a v3 user account.
</Callout>

### Verify the device is matched to the correct profile

If the previous test passes, then you'll want to verify that the configured value for `mib_profile` in your `snmp-base.yaml` file matches the correct profile file name.

Example:

```yaml
devices:
  deviceOne:
    ...
    mib_profile: cisco-catalyst.yml
    ...
```

You can check this in New Relic with the following NRQL query (replace `$DEVICE_NAME` with the name of your device):

```
FROM Metric SELECT 
latest(instrumentation.name) 
WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'kentik' 
AND device_name = '$DEVICE_NAME'
```

The library of SNMP profiles is constantly being updated and it can sometimes occur that the container image you're using doesn't have the profile settings you're seeking. If the `mib_profile` doesn't match the expected profile, you can either manually update your config file, or run a new discovery.

<Callout variant="tip">
You should always pull the latest image for your container before making changes: `docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2`
</Callout>

### Verify the OID is listed in the device profile

If the previous tests are all passing, the last item to check is whether the OID exists in the device profile itself. Whether the OID is listed and not working as expected, or the OID needs to be added to the profile, [opening an issue on the GitHub repo](https://github.com/kentik/snmp-profiles/issues/new/choose) is the next step to take and engage with the repo maintainers to work towards a resolution.
