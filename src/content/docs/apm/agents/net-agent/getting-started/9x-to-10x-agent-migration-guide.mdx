This guide outlines the major changes between the 8.x and 9.x versions of the .NET agent, issues that you may encounter while upgrading, and how to migrate successfully to version 9.x.

Main changes include:

* The .NET Agent no longer support EOLed Frameworks
* Removal of deprecated scriptatable installer 
* Removal of deprecated instrumentation
* Linux installer packages name change

## The .NET Agent no longer support EOLed Frameworks

Microsoft has announced .NET Framework <= 4.6.1 and .NET Core <= 3.0 reached End of Support. Maintaining support for EOLed frameworks keeps us from utilizing latest technologies; therefore, the .NET Agent ver 10.0 and later will stop instrumenting applications that built with these frameworks.

It is recommended that customers should migrate their applications to use the supported framework versions. In the event where framework migration isn't an option, customers can still instrument their applications with the 9.x .NET Agent.

## Removal of deprecated scriptatable installer

Starting from v10.x, we will stop providing scriptatable installers from our download site.

## Linux installer packages name change


## Removal of deprecated instrumentation

Starting from v10.x, the .NET Agent stops instrumenting Castle MonoRail. Customers can still use older versions of the .NET Agent to instrument this library.
