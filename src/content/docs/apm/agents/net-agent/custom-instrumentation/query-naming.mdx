New Relic .NET agent instruments and groups your application's SQL queries. Normally, the .NET agent will automatically assign a name to a query based on the properties of the query. Alternatively, we give you the ability to assign a custom name to queries.

## How to name a query [#name-query]

This is done by adding a parseable comment of the form ```/* NewRelicQueryName: myQueryName */``` within the query text.

To name a query being made by your application, simply add a comment of the above format anywhere within the query text. For example:

```
var connection = new MySqlConnection(mySqlConnectionString);
var command = new MySqlCommand("/* NewRelicQueryName: My query name */ SELECT date FROM dates", connection);
``` 

<Callout variant="tip">
  Queries of all supported versions of SQL can be named in the described manner.
</Callout>

## Find named queries [#find-named-query]

Database and query data can be found in Monitor>Databases in the navigation panel. A named query will appear with it's name in brackets like so:

<img
  title="named_query.png"
  alt="named_query.png"
  src={namedQuery}
/>
