Want to start monitoring your Node.js application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM]() and [Introduction to New Relic for Node.js]() are good places to start. If you'd like to learn more about the general installation process, see our Node.js installation overview.

## What do you want to monitor?

We have some options for our install, depending on how your app is deployed.

To install with a package manager, follow [these steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=773dd1ee-a7a0-1450-0a0e-3daf0035c807) in our guided install. This method has you install the agent with `apm` in the command line.

<Callout variant="tip">
    If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container.
</Callout>

To [install the Node.js agent for Docker](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent-docker/), you'll use the command line to build, configure, and deploy the agent in your Docker app. Make sure you have your license key and what you named your app, as certain steps require them.

Follow this [non-standard guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=31668b21-7bb1-8d71-01b4-c5de77b3382b) if your app is managed by PM2. This is a manual install via the command line using `curl`, `bash`, and `sudo`.   

If you use a different process manager (or maybe you don't use one at all), then you'll want to install via our [standard guided install page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=4475f6ac-b76d-5b68-f00d-16c026bc9b65).

To install an agent for your AWS Lambda functions, our [self-guided steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=c8a6be34-2449-db6e-3e81-dc710a7aae18) provides a setup script that automatically configures AWS for you.

If you have a preference for manual installation via the command line, we currently have the option for [Legacy instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/#node).
