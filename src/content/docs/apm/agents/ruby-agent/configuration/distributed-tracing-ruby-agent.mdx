Distributed tracing allows you to see the entire journey of your requests throughout a [distributed system](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing). It is turned on by default in current New Relic Ruby agents, but you can also enable it manually in older agents.

Here are several ways to set up distributed tracing:

* [New agent installations (recommended):](#quick-start-apm) A fast way to get started
* [Infinite Tracing:](#infinite-tracing) An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing
* [Older APM agents:](#older-agents) Tracing options if you have older APM agents
* [Manual instrumentation:](#manual-instrumentation) Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics:

  * [How span sampling works](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#sampling) explains distributed tracing options.
  * [Impacts to APM](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/transition-guide-distributed-tracing) tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing.
</Callout>

## New agent installations (recommended) [#quick-start-apm]

When you install a current New Relic agent, [standard distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#head-based) is enabled by default. So, if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet, or you want to instrument additional services with this agent, follow the steps in this section.

If you already have some services instrumented with this APM agent, and you want to include them in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing for each service. See [Options for older APM agents](#older-agents).

You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly [create a free account](https://newrelic.com/signup). Note that this link will take you to another site to complete the sign-up, but you can return here and follow the setup steps below:

### Step 1. Identify services

Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic.

### Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent [#update-agents]

You'll repeat the agent installation routine for each service involved in your transactions. If some of your services use other languages, simply repeat the [installation steps](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) for those languages.

To start the installation routine, click the tile below. When you are finished installing each agent, return here to see tips for [viewing your traces](#view-traces).

</TechTileGrid>

### Step 3. View traces [#view-traces]

After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="entity-explorer"
    title="View traces that include a specific service"
  >
    Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**.
    2. Click **APM** in the top menu bar.
    3. Click your service.
    4. In the left navigation's **Monitor** section, click **Distributed tracing**.
    5. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the `trace.id`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dt-launcher"
    title="View traces across accounts"
  >
    This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to.

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**.
    2. Click **Browse data** in the top menu bar, and then click **Traces**.
    3. Select your entity in the left pane.
    4. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the `trace.id`.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="logs-context"
    title="Examine logs for trace details"
  >
    You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

    1. From the **Transactions** page, click on a trace to go to the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
    2. From the trace details page, click **See logs**.
    3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) [#infinite-tracing]

Standard distributed tracing for APM agents ([above](#quick-start-apm)) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To learn more about this feature, see [Infinite Tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing).
</Callout>

Before beginning, first ensure you meet [the requirements](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing#requirements).

### Step 1. Complete the new agent installation [#install-agents-first]

The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the [new agent installation](#quick-start-apm) for standard distributed tracing. After you finish installing the agents, continue with the trace observer setup.

### Step 2. Set up the trace observer [#provision-trace-observer]

The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in [Set up trace observer](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer). When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent.

### Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing

Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Note that server-side configuration is not available for Infinite Tracing.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ruby-config"
    title="Ruby Infinite Tracing configuration "
  >
    Here's an overview of the settings. For more help with configuration, see [Ruby agent configuration](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#distributed_tracing).

    To set up Infinite Tracing, you need to install the Infinite Tracing gem. The gem is available in [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/newrelic-infinite_tracing). For applications using Bundler, additionally include the Infinite Tracing gem in the Gemfile:

    ```
    gem 'newrelic-infinite_tracing'
    ```

    If you're using Rails 3 or higher, or Rails 2.3 in the [recommended configuration](http://bundler.io/v1.12/rails3.html), Rails will automatically call `Bundler.require` and cause `newrelic-infinite_tracing` to be required during startup of your application. If you're using Sinatra or another framework, you must manually call `require 'newrelic/infinite_tracing'` or manually call `Bundler.require`.

</Callout>

### Step 4. (Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing

After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing:

* [Configure trace observer monitoring](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-trace-observer-monitoring)
* [Configure span attribute trace filter](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-span-attribute-trace-filter)
* [Configure random trace filter](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-random-trace-filter)

## Options for older APM agents [#older-agents]

If you have older APM agents, confirm the distributed tracing features you want are supported before enabling it.

### Compatibility guide

After reviewing the compatibility information below, see [Configure your older Ruby agents](#configure-agents).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="ruby-version"
    title="Ruby agent compatibility"
  >
    [Install](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/install-new-relic-ruby-agent) or [update](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/update-ruby-agent) to the required Ruby agent version. For Infinite Tracing, you also need to install the [Infinite Tracing gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/newrelic-infinite_tracing). For best results, update to the [latest Ruby agent version](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes) and [Infinite Tracing gem version](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/blob/main/infinite_tracing/CHANGELOG.md), if applicable.

### Configure standard distributed tracing for your older agents [#configure-agents]

Distributed tracing is enabled through configuration settings. Review the following agent-specific sections. For general help with agent configurations, see [Configure the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/configure-agent).

<Callout variant="important">
  Server-side configuration is not available for Infinite Tracing.

    </table>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) [#manual-instrumentation]

**Recommendation:** Before performing any custom instrumentation, read:

* [How distributed tracing works](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works)
* [Troubleshoot missing data](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-missing-trace-data)

If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the [calling service](#calling-service) and the [called service](#called-service). The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="calling-service"
    title="Instrument the calling service"
  >
    To instrument the calling service:

    1. Ensure the [version of the APM agent](#compatibility-requirements) that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing.
    2. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload (see the [Ruby agent API](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/guide-using-ruby-agent-api#distributed).
      <Callout variant="important">
         To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you **generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it**.
      </Callout>
    3. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header).
    4. (Optional) Identify the call as an external call (see the [Ruby agent API](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/guide-using-ruby-agent-api#externals)).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="called-service"
    title="Instrument the called service"
  >
    To instrument the called service:

    1. Ensure the [version of the APM agent](#compatibility-requirements) that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing.
    2. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction:

      <CollapserGroup>
        <Collapser
          id="ruby-create"
          title="Ruby"
        >
          If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the [`add_transaction_tracer` API method](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/ruby-custom-instrumentation#transaction-tracers).
        </Collapser>
      </CollapserGroup>
    3. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header).
    4. Invoke the call for accepting the payload (see the [Ruby agent API](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/api-guides/guide-using-ruby-agent-api#distributed).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
