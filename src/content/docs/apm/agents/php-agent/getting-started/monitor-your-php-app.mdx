Want to start monitoring your PHP application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm) and [Introduction to New Relic for PHP](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) are a good place to start.

We have different avenues for instrumenting your Docker app with the PHP agent.  

   * Install via our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=f7b6a041-0c88-a50f-26f1-ba546cdc5ae6) if you want your daemon and PHP agent in different containers. If you still need to create your daemon, follow the additional steps in [Docker and other container environments](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent#daemon-container) 
   * To set up the agent and daemon in the same container, follow [these steps](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent#install-same-container). This involves downloading the [tar archive](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file/) for the PHP agent.

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=f7b6a041-0c88-a50f-26f1-ba546cdc5ae6) uses `yum` to install the agent just like our manual installation. The guided install is a great option if you want more visibility and certainty about where you are in the install process. 
* Our [manual install](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-aws-linux-redhat-centos#manager-tarball) walks you through the same process, but lets you manage every step from your command line.
