Want to start monitoring your PHP application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm) and [Introduction to New Relic for PHP](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) are a good place to start.

We have different avenues for instrumenting your Docker app with the PHP agent.  

   * Install via our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?account=3501165&state=f7b6a041-0c88-a50f-26f1-ba546cdc5ae6) if you want your daemon and PHP agent in different containers. If you still need to create your daemon, follow the additional steps in [Docker and other container environments](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent#daemon-container) 
   * To set up the agent and daemon in the same container, follow [these steps](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent#install-same-container). This involves downloading the [tar archive](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file/) for the PHP agent.

If you're using a package manager, follow [these interactive procedural steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=9eb6ee63-99a3-67fa-ac41-57ce46b53ecc). In step 2, select either `apt` for Debian or Ubuntu, or `yum` for AWS Linux, CentOS, or RedHat.

If you're installing mannually without a package manager, [our tar archive installation doc](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file/) walks you through installing via the command line. This is a good option if you've got multiple PHP apps.

* [Configure the PHP agent](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/)
* [Configure the PHP agent's proxy daemon](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/proxy-daemon-newreliccfg-settings/).
* Learn about your app's Apdex score to get [a high-level summary of your app](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data/)
* Connect your logs and APM data with [PHP logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php/).
