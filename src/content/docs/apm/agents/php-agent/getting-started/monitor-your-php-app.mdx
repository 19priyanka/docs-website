Want to start monitoring your PHP application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM]() and [Introduction to New Relic for PHP]() are good places to start. If you'd like to learn more about the general installation process, see our PHP installation overview.

## What do you want to monitor?

   If your PHP app runs on FPM, Nginx, or Apache, you can follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=2b9d3294-1f7f-0a48-7117-3f5a33200e14). This is a command line installer.

   To install on Docker, follow our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=9eb6ee63-99a3-67fa-ac41-57ce46b53ecc). In step 2, select **Docker**.

Alternatively, our manual installation docs walk you through setting up your agent and daemon through our command line:

   * [Install agent and daemon in different containers](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent/#install-diff-containers)
   * [Install agent and daemon in the same container](docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent/#install-same-container)

If you're using a package manager, follow [these interactive procedural steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=9eb6ee63-99a3-67fa-ac41-57ce46b53ecc). In step 2, select either `apt` for Debian or Ubuntu, or `yum` for AWS Linux, CentOS, or RedHat.

    title="Manual installation without package manager"

If you're installing mannually without a package manager, [our tar archive installation doc](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file/) walks you through installing via the command line. This is a good option if you've got multiple PHP apps.

To install the PHP agent through one of our partnerships, check out these guides:

   * For AWS hosted apps, install the [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup). If you want to know more about New Relic and AWS integrations, read our [Intro to AWS integrations](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations/) doc.
   * [Heroku](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/php-agent-heroku/#installing)

## What's next?

So you've installed the PHP agent and want some next steps. We have some options for further customizing your agent:

* [Configure the PHP agent](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/)
* [Configure the PHP agent's proxy daemon](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/proxy-daemon-newreliccfg-settings/).
* Learn about your app's Apdex score to get [a high-level summary of your app](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data/)
* Connect your logs and APM data with [PHP logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php/).
