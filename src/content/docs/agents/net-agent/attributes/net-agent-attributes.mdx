metaDescription: A summary of attributes captured by New Relic's .NET agent.

[Attributes](/docs/features/agent-attributes) are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. These key-value pairs can be viewed within transaction traces in APM, traced errors in APM, transaction events in dashboards, and page views in dashboards. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations.

These attribute settings apply to version 3.6.177.0 or higher of the .NET agent.
