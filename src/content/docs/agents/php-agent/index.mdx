The New Relic PHP agent monitors your application to help you [identify and solve performance issues](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php#monitor-performance). You can also extend the agent's performance monitoring to [collect and analyze business data](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php#business-data) to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions.

To keep your agent up to date and ensure you have access to the latest features, see the [PHP agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes).
