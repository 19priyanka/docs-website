## Problem

When a security scan is performed, it reports back with a high number of false positive security vulnerabilities.

## Cause

The security scan flagged the `.jar` files as vulnerable due to the class and method names we use to identify sources for instrumentation. However, our instrumentation code is not part of the vulnerable libraries and the vulnerable libraries do not exist in our `.jar` files, which contain only New Relic code.

## Solution
Suppress the false positive warnings coming from the `instrumentation` package in the newrelic.jar in whatever way the scanning tool you are using provides.

For example, false positives discovered by the `DependencyCheck` project here: https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck can be suppressed with:

```
<suppress>
    <notes><![CDATA[newrelic-agent false positives due to the instrumentation package]]></notes>
    <filePath regex="true">.*newrelic-agent-.*\.jar[\\\/]instrumentation.*\.jar</filePath>
    <cpe regex="true">.*
</suppress>
```
Consult your security scan vendor for the appropriate configuration to suppress false positives.
