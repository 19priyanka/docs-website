With New Relic's Java agent, you can track everything from performance issues to tiny errors within your code.

After installing, you will be able to quickly monitor transactions, dive deep into errors, and more.

To keep your agent up to date and ensure you have access to the latest features, see the [Java agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes).
