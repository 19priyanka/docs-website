New Relic for Python monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve [performance issues](#monitor-performance). You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze [business data](#business-data) to help you improve the customer experience and to make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for [custom instrumentation and APIs](/docs/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation), New Relic for Python offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need for your app.

To keep your agent up to date and ensure you have access to the latest features, see the [Python agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes).
