New Relic's Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you:

* Identify and solve performance issues.
* Improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions.
* Monitor data from detailed dashboards in [New Relic APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm), [New Relic Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure), and other [New Relic products](https://newrelic.com/products).
* Query, visualize, and share your data via [New Relic Insights](/docs/insights/using-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights).

To keep your agent up to date and ensure you have access to the latest features, see the [Go agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes).
