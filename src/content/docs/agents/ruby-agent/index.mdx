As the first in New Relic's family of language agents, the Ruby agent combines years of proven stability with ongoing feature releases. Use the Ruby agent to:

* [Identify problems and improve](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-ruby#monitor-performance) your app's performance.
* Monitor data from detailed dashboards in [New Relic APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm), [New Relic Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser), and other [New Relic products](https://newrelic.com/products).
* Query, visualize, and share your data with [New Relic Insights](/docs/insights/using-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights).

To keep your agent up to date and ensure you have access to the latest features, see the [Ruby agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes).
