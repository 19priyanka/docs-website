![New Relic Android app main menu](/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/navigation_nexus.jpg "New Relic Android app main menu")The user interface for New Relic's Android app provides functionality similar to New Relic's standard user interface, with customized details for mobile users.

## Requirements

Requirements include:

*   Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher
*   Screen size of 7 inches or less

## Install New Relic's mobile app

You can install the New Relic Android app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newrelic.rpm "Link opens in a new window") or learn more from the [New Relic website](https://newrelic.com/mobility). Follow standard procedures to install any Android app, then sign in with your New Relic user name (account email) and password if applicable.

Depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or [user authentication](/docs/mobile-apps/new-relic-mobile-apps/authentication-alerts/user-settings-authentication) steps may be required.
