**Owner or Admins**

Account administrators can set up configuration to receive push notifications on Android and iOS devices from [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/new-relic-alerts). You can receive alerts from any policy by attaching a user channel to the policy.

## Turn notifications on or off

When you log in to your New Relic account from an Android or iOS app, your device is automatically associated with your [user channel](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#user). Be sure to [add the associated user channel to the alert policy](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts#mobile-push).

1.  Android devices: Tap the notification from the notification drawer.
    
    OR
    
    iOS devices: Swipe the screen.
    
2.  From the New Relic app's **Alerts** menu, select any alert to view error details for the associated application.
3.  Optional: Select **Acknowledge**.
4.  Optional: To view additional details, select **Overview**, **Violations**, or **Event log**.

The main menu's **Alerts** list shows alerts in the following order, sorted by time:

*   Active incidents
*   Resolved incidents from today
*   Resolved incidents and events from the past week, organized by day

## Troubleshoot alert settings

If alerts are not working on your mobile device:

1.  Verify that [alerts are enabled](#enabling-alerts).
2.  Check your mobile device's [notification settings](#notification-settings), to ensure New Relic is permitted to send alerts.

If the notification settings for your mobile device are correct, but you still do not receive notifications, [delete the device from your account](#account-delete), then [uninstall](#uninstall-app) and [reinstall](#reinstall-app) the New Relic application.

Check notification settings for your mobile device.
