*This is the fourth part of [the New Relic implementation guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-intro).*

In previous implementation stages, you [instrumented your stack](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-instrument) and [became acquainted with the New Relic platform](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-organize-data). Now is a good time to think about proactive solutions that will notify you of problems early and help you avoid worst-case scenarios. In this stage, you'll learn about some important solutions in this area, including: 

* Alerting
* Synthetic monitors
* Errors inbox
