*This is the second part of [the New Relic implementation guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/implementation-guide-intro).*

Organizations that are most successful with their observability goals are those that get telemetry data reporting from all the relevant components in their stack. In this stage of the setup, we'll walk you through setting up tools that should give you a strong observability foundation that you can then build on.

In this stage, you'll:

* Set up some infrastructure monitoring tools. 
* Set up application monitoring, which can include one or more of these:
  * Our APM agents, for monitoring popular language-specific frameworks.
  * Our other solutions for application monitoring, including OpenTelemetry, StatsD, or other services and APIs.
* Set up browser monitoring, if your app has a web user interface.
* Set up mobile monitoring, if your app has a mobile app interface.

## Deploying New Relic at scale [#deploy-scale]

If you're currently deploying your hosts and application(s) at scale, it will make sense to also automate your New Relic tooling by including it in your automation and provisioning pipelines. 

This guide will walk you through some standard install procedures but many of these can be automated in various ways. If you plan on deploying New Relic at scale, consider assigning team members to work on that project. If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, work with your account representative. 

Some resources for deploying at scale: 
* [Workflow automating resources](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows)
* Our [observability-as-code guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/observability-maturity/operational-efficiency/observability-as-code-guide)

## Infrastructure monitoring [#infrastructure]

New Relic infrastructure monitoring provides you with a complete view of the health and configuration changes for your entire host ecosystem, across all environments. 

Our infrastructure monitoring comprises a variety of tools, ranging from our infrastructure agent that installs on your hosts and instruments common operating systems, to our Docker and Kubernetes integrations, to our cloud platform integrations that report telemetry data from the cloud services you use, to our integrations for many popular infrastructure-related services.

Watch a 6 minute video showing what infrastructure monitoring can do for you:

If you've already instrumented some of your infrastructure, you should see it in the Infrastructure UI. If you haven't yet done this, or need to add more data, this section will give you some recommended paths.  

### Guided install [#infra-guided-install]

The guided install is a good choice for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic before a more comprehensive install. The guided install auto-discovers your environment and installs applicable solutions, including our infrastructure agent, some infrastructure-related integrations, our Kubernetes integration, APM agents, and some log instrumentation. It works in most common environments, including common operating systems, in Docker containers, and apps in Kubernetes.

The guided install can be a good option for testing out and prototyping before a larger deployment. If you'd prefer to install things manually or have more control over the installation process, see the manual install section below.

To watch someone use the guided install to add data and dashboards in just a few minutes, watch this 5-minute video:
