This guide walks you through a recommend path for setting up New Relic quickly. 

## Before you start [#before-start]

Some important points before you start: 

* There are many ways to set up New Relic, depending on your system and your goals. This guide walks you through a quick setup that many customers find useful. 
* This guide will tend to be most useful for smaller organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic before doing a more in-depth, at-scale rollout. If you'd like to instead add monitoring for some specific technologies, see [Install New Relic](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/install-configure/install-new-relic). 
* When you're done with this guide, you can complete your setup by adding more data and doing additional configuration. 
* If you get stuck, see [the docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com) for docs for a specific feature. Or check [our Nerd Bytes YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmhYj7Jl81JEV-llIDkCVC05tD7fbOv_b) for helpful how-to videos or [New Relic University](https://learn.newrelic.com) for in-depth training.

        If your organization doesn't yet have New Relic, [sign up here](https://newrelic.com/signup). No credit card needed and you get 100 GBs of data per month for free. [Learn more about estimating costs.](https://newrelic.com/blog/nerdlog/estimate-data-cost) 

        Does your organization already have New Relic but you're just adding a new team or project? See [Add a new account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).

        Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==) auto-discovers infrastructure and app components, and gets some data flowing quickly. If you prefer a more manual approach (for example, if you need to deploy at scale), see the options directly below. Note that enabling infrastructure monitoring and APM will get you some log data reporting out-of-the-box.

Below are some manual install procedures for some of our most popular tools. 

Manual install docs: 

* Infrastructure: 
  * [Install infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/#install) 
  * [Install Kubernetes integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/install-kubernetes-integration-using-helm)  
  * Install cloud platforms: [AWS](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations), [Azure](/docs/infrastructure/microsoft-azure-integrations/get-started/introduction-azure-monitoring-integrations), [GCP](/docs/infrastructure/google-cloud-platform-integrations/get-started/introduction-google-cloud-platform-integrations)
  * [Other infrastructure integrations](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/?category=infrastructure-and-os)

Now that you've got some data coming in, it's time to explore your environment in real time with some out-of-the-box UI views. You should see data in the **Infrastructure**, **APM**, and **Logs** UI pages (if you don't see that, consider revisiting the install instructions). 

Some tips on understanding those UI pages and more: 
* Video: [An introduction to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZCUujeAkMA) 
* [APM UI docs](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data)
* [Infrastructure UI docs](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-ui-entities)
* [Logs UI docs](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)
* [Distributed tracing UI docs](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui) 
* [Service maps](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/service-maps/introduction-service-maps)
