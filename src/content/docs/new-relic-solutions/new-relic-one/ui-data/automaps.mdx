The New Relic automap feature displays entity-centric maps to help you troubleshoot incidents that cascade through interconnected services. With automap, you can pinpoint when and where an issue began by viewing the relationships around your affected entity.

To use automap, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a free account.

## How it works [#how-works]

You can get the automap view of a source entity via **Service maps**  or **Workloads**. To learn more about UI changes in the automap view, check out [Maps in context](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/ui-data/maps-in-context).

Automap displays relationships between entities in your architecture based on direct calls between services. For example, APM services are represented as vertices (hexagons) and direct calls are represented as edges (lines) on the graph. This shows you how these services depend on one another.

You can think of automap as a distinct maps view that breaks a source entity out of groupings shown in the omnimap view via **Service maps** or **Workloads**. In the above screenshot, you can see entities that are two relationships away from your source entity. Compare how automap adjusts to a relationship depth of three instead of two:

<img
  title="Automap view from New Relic"
  alt="A screenshot of automap from the New Relic UI. This map is set to three relationships out from the source entity."
  src={omnimapAutomapViewRel3}
/>

To understand entities and relationships, as well as how the entity platform synthesizes both from telemetry data, see [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/) and [relationships](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial/).

<Callout variant="important">
  Automap auto-expand logic relies on the health status of an entity, which is largely determined by the alert status of that entity. For optimal troubleshooting with automap, ensure that your [alerts are properly configured](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/alerts-applied-intelligence/alerts-best-practices/).

## Open automap [#open-automap]

To view automap, go to **one.newrelic.com**, then select **APM & services** in the left pane.

1. From the **APM & services** menu, select your source entity.
2. Select **Service map** under **Monitor**.
3. Hover your cursor over your source entity, then click **Map from this entity** in the tooltip. 

<img
     title="Open automap from service maps"
     alt="A screenshot of the tooltip that appears when you hover your cursor over an entity."
     src={omnimapAutomapTooltip}
   />

You can also open automap by scrolling to the bottom of the right pane. When you reach **Related entities** at the bottom, click **See full map**.

Automap is available for the following types of entities:

  <thead>
    <tr>

## Timewarp cursor: Go back in time [#timewarp-cursor]

Once you've settled on your desired relationship depth, you can use our timewarp feature to explore changes between these entities from the last three hours. Simply move the **Timewarp** cursor to see health status changes for the entities on the map. 

<img
  title="Timewarp in automap view"
  alt="A screenshot of where to find the timewarp feature in the automap UI. You can find timewarp by going to the top pane and moving to the right."
  src={omnimapTimewarp}
/>

## Controls: See only what you need to see [#filter-automap]

With the **Health status** and **Entity types** dropdowns available to the left of **Timewarp**, you can de-emphasize certain entities on the map by unchecking those options. For example, you can hide the healthy service to focus only on those alerting as you browse the timeline:

   <img
     title="Screenshot showing the top pane, where you can control what you see in automap"
     alt="A screenshot showing two dropdowns that let you control what you see in automap. The screenshot has Not alerting entities and Synthetic monitoring entities de-selected, which alters automap."
     src={omnimapAutomapControls}
   />

## Map symbols [#map-symbols]

Here's a table showing the various health status icons:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Health status
      </th>

      <th style="text-align:center">

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

          alt="Screenshot showing the red critical hexagon"
          src={criticalHealthStatus}

      </td>

          src={notConfiguredHealthStatus}

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
