- Identify and prioritize observability objectives.
- Coordinate stakeholders in your organization to develop consensus ingest targets.
- Publish forecast and work with NR account team to steer toward the targets.

## Desired outcome [#desired-outcome]
Use the analysis produced in the baselining stage along with the observability value goals from the optimizing stage to produce future looking estimates for ingest for the coming months, and even years.
