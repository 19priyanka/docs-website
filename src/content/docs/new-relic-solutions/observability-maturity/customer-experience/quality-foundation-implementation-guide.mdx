## Overview [#overview]

Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience:

- Availability (Is it reachable?)
- Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?)
- Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?)
- Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?)

![Digital customer experience](./images/cx-what-you-can-measure-nr.png "Digital Customer Experienc-DCX-What you can measure with New Relic")

Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience.

Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way.

## Desired Outcome [#desired-outcome]
This implementation guide will help you:

* Look at customer experience in relation to:
    * Global functions, such as search and login
    * Lines of business
    * Regions
* Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about
* Prioritize what you work on
* Create a repeatable practice

## Key Performance Indicators

Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="js-errors-kpi"
    title="JavaScript error rate KPI"
  >
    This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view.

    **Goal:**

    * Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering.
    * Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="http-errors-kpi"
    title="HTTP error rate KPI"
  >
    HTTP errors (or HTTP `4xx` and `5xx` responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful.

    **Goal:**

    Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do.

  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    id="ttfb-kpi"
    title="Time to first byte KPI"
  >
    This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server.

    **Goal:**

    Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance.

  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    id="core-web-lcp-kpi"
    title="Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI"
  >
    [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are part of Google’s [Page Experience Metrics](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/more-details-page-experience). They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page.

    **Goal:**

    * Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages.
    * Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages.

  </Collapser>
  
  <Collapser
    id="core-web-kpi"
    title="Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI"
  >
    This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering.

    **Goal:**

    Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="layout-shift-kpi"
    title="Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI"
  >
    This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render.

    **Goal:**

    Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages.

  </Collapser>

## Prerequisites

### Required knowledge

* Familiarity with [synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/)
* Familiarity with [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/)
* Familiarity with [basic Browser UI views](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/getting-started/introduction-browser-monitoring/)
* Familiarity with [SPA data in Browser UI](/docs/browser/single-page-app-monitoring/use-spa-data/view-spa-data-browser-ui/)

## Required Installation and Configuration

* [Browser Pro installed in all pages](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/)
* [SPA enabled for single page applications](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/full-stack-observability/browser-monitoring-best-practices-guide/#how-to-do-it)
*  Synthetics monitors configured:

    - [Ping monitors configured for anonymous users ](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/)
    - [Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/store-secure-credentials-scripted-browsers-api-tests/)
    - Monitors should be configured to [test from all regions applicable to your users](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors/#setting-location)
    - Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow
* Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint.

## Establish current state [#current-state]

### Tune Browser Configuration

#### Review Instrumented Pages

Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is.  You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query:

```
SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX 
```

You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID.

#### Validate Browser URL Grouping

Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. 

A segment is the text between two `/` in a URL or between `.` of a domain name. For example, in the URL `website.com/product/widget-name`, the segments are:

* `website`
* `.com`
* `product`
* `widget-name`

When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that `website.com/product/widget-name` becomes `website.com/` **or** `website.com/product/`. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product.

Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the [Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/oma-resource-center/tree/main/src/content/docs/oma/value-drivers/customer-experience/use-cases/quality-foundation#readme) to help.

![cx_segment_whitelist_investigation](./images/cx_segment_whitelist_investigation.png "Segment Allow List (Whitelist) investigation")

Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using [Segment allow lists in Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/#adding).

### Understand How You Will Segment Your Data

Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in [segment allow lists](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/configuration/group-browser-metrics-urls/#adding).

Consider the following statements:

* Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay.
* On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint.
* Last week, there were 1 million page views.

Compared to:

* Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this.
* Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds.
* Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience.

Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        xx
      </th>

      <th>
        xx
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        xx
      </td>

      <td>
        xx
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
