  Here's a fast way to start sending your tracing data to New Relic with our integrations or third-party tools. 
  
  

  1. **Identify services:** Decide which services you want to report traces.
  2. **Instrument services:** Click the button below to start assisted or manual instrumentation of each service.

  3. **View your traces:** After you instrument each service and generate some traffic, you can see the data in our UI.
