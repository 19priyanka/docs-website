  You can send tracing data to New Relic using either our integrations or third-party tools. To get started with default tracing–either head-based sampling or no sampling–you can start here or see [Set up distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/overivew-enable-distributed-tracing.mdx). 
  
  In a nutshell, you'll do the following:

  1. **Identify services:** Decide which services you want to report traces
  2. **Instrument services:** Automatically or manually set up each service to send traces
