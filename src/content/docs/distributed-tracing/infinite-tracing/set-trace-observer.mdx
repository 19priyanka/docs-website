If you are following the [steps](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) to set up distributed tracing and are continuing with the steps for the advanced option called Infinite Tracing, you need to set up a trace observer. The trace observer is what allows you to go beyond the basic [head-based sampling](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#head-based) of standard distributed tracing. 

The trace observer is a cloud-based New Relic tool that uses [tail-based sampling](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#tail-based) to decide what trace data to keep and send to New Relic. The trace observer lives in New Relic Edge, which is an AWS-based service that provides you with a low-latency and low-cost way to send your telemetry data to New Relic. The trace observer sends data via our Trace API, which is the entry point for all distributed trace data we ingest.

Ask yourself these questions:

* Are you in the right place? These instructions are for setting up the advanced Infinite Tracing feature, which has some other initial setup steps, depending on your product. So, if you landed here before doing the initial setup tasks, you should back up and [start there first](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start).
* Do some of your requests touch services that are still using standard distributed tracing? To avoid [configuration conflicts](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/infinite-tracing-trace-configuration-conflicts), you should ideally enable Infinite Tracing for all associated services.

## Before you get started [#before-starting]

Before you begin the steps in the next section to create a trace observer, make sure you understand what to expect when you set this up:

1. You create the trace observer that has a special endpoint.
2. You take steps to route traffic from your services to the new endpoint.

The first step of creating trace observers is the same no matter what type of tool you're using to send spans (APM, browser, etc.). However, the way you route data from services to that special endpoint depends on which tool you're using:

* **Routing for APM agents, OpenTelemetry, and Kamon**: You copy the endpoint from the trace observer setup and insert it into the tool's configuration for each associated distributed service. Instructions for this are available in the documentation for these tools.
* **Routing for New Relic browser, mobile, and lambda**: After you create the trace observer in the New Relic Edge app, you remain in the Edge app and specify which data sources (entities) should route data to the new Infinite Tracing endpoint. You don't need to do any routing configuration in the remote services. 

## Create the trace observer [#set-up]

To create a new trace observer:

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), and click **Apps**. Under **Your apps**, click **New Relic Edge**.
2. Select an account in the upper-left dropdown. If you have access to multiple accounts, make sure you're in the account where you want Infinite Tracing enabled.
3. If no trace observers are already present, click **New trace observer** to add one, fill out the information, and click **Create**.

   <Callout variant="important">
     Note: If you select a trace observer in an EU region, youâ€™ll still need a US-based New Relic account because data is reported to US data centers.
   </Callout>
4. Under the **Endpoints** dropdown:
   * Copy the **For other integrations** endpoint value and have it ready: this will be referred to in later instructions as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>.
   * If you're enabling a [language agent](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing), also copy the **For language agents** value and have it ready: this will be referred to as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST</var>.

## Trace observer endpoints [#endpoints]

In the trace observer UI, there's an **Endpoints** dropdown. When [setting up the trace observer](#set-up), we have you copy these values for use at various points of our tracing tool setup instructions. There are two values:

* **For language agents**: This value is referenced in our code examples as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST</var>. This is used for [configuring our language agents to send data to the trace observer](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing#configure-agents).
* **For other integrations**: This value is referenced in our code examples as <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>. This is used for configuring our [telemetry integrations](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing) and for sending data via the [Trace API](/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api/) (including sending [sample payloads](#sample-payload)).

## (Optional) Test the trace observer [#test]

 (Optional but recommended) To verify things are working, we recommend sending a sample trace payload. If you're using our [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api): this step is especially recommended to learn how the API works.

       <Callout variant="important">
         If you're using Zipkin-format data, see [Send Zipkin payload](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/report-zipkin-format-traces-trace-api#send-zipkin-curl).
       </Callout>

       This test sends a sample trace payload with one trace and two spans from a service named `Test Service A`.

       To send this sample request:

       1. Get the [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) for the account you want to report data to and have it ready.
       2. Copy the following `curl` request into a text editor:

          ```
          curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -H "Api-Key: <var>$YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</var>" \
            -H 'Data-Format: newrelic' \
            -H 'Data-Format-Version: 1' \
            -X POST \

                {
                    "common": {
                    "attributes": {
                        "environment": "staging"
                    }
                    },
                    "spans": [
                    {
                        "trace.id": "123456",
                        "id": "ABC",
                        "attributes": {
                            "duration.ms": 12.53,
                            "host": "host123.example.com",
                            "name": "/home",
                            "service.name": "Test Service A"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "trace.id": "123456",
                        "id": "DEF",
                        "attributes": {
                            "duration.ms": 2.97,
                            "host": "host456.example.com",
                            "error.message": "Invalid credentials",
                            "name": "/auth",
                            "parent.id": "ABC",
                            "service.name": "Test Service B"
                        }
                    }
                    ]
                }
                ]' \
          '<var>$YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>'
          ```
       3. Insert your own values into the `curl` request:

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>
                  Value
                </th>

                <th>
                  Description
                </th>
              </tr>
            </thead>

            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>
                  <var>
                    $YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
                  </var>
                </td>

                <td>
                  Replace this with your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).
                </td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td>
                  <var>
                    $YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL
                  </var>
                </td>

                <td>
                  Replace this with the **For other integrations** endpoint value you copied in a previous step.
                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
       4. Copy the curl request into a terminal and execute it.
       5. The test should return `HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted`, indicating success. If it does not, check the following common issues:
          * Confirm that you used the [**For other integrations** endpoint](#endpoints) value.
          * Confirm you're using single quotes around <var>YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL</var>.
          * Check that you're using the correct API key.
       6. If your test returned `HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted`, go to the New Relic UI to see a query of the sample payload data using the span attribute `service.name = Test Service A` ([here's a link for that query](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/distributed-tracing-nerdlets.distributed-tracing?launcher=eyJ0aW1lUmFuZ2UiOnsiYmVnaW5fdGltZSI6bnVsbCwiZW5kX3RpbWUiOm51bGwsImR1cmF0aW9uIjoxODAwMDAwfSwiJGlzRmFsbGJhY2tUaW1lUmFuZ2UiOnRydWV9&pane=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)). Because the sample payload contains an error attribute, the error sampler will mark it for keeping. If you modify the payload to remove the error attributes, the random sampler may not choose to keep this particular trace.

## (Optional) Make additional trace observer configurations [#config]

You can control the behavior of the trace observer with various configurations. You may want to wait until after you've worked with this feature for a while. Here are some of the features you can configure:

* [Configure trace observer monitoring](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-trace-observer-monitoring/): Allows you to see the amount of traces seen and retained.
* [Configure span attribute trace filter](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-span-attribute-trace-filter/): Make custom filter rules for spans.
* [Infinite Tracing: Configure random trace filter](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-random-trace-filter): Adjust the percentage of for the random trace filter.

This procedure is complete. Next, return to finish any remaining instructions for the tracing tool you started enabling:

   * [Language agents](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/language-agents-enable-distributed-tracing#configure-agents)
   * [Third-party telemetry integrations](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/integrations-enable-distributed-tracing#configure-integration) (OpenTelemetry and others)
   * [Trace API](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api): once the trace observer is set up, you're finished and can start instrumenting your application.
