## Overview

Before you jump into the specifics of distributed tracing for particular products, review these main steps for each type of distributed tracing:

  ![The three steps to set up distributed tracing](./images/three-steps.png) 

1. **Identify services:** As you get started, decide which services you want to keep track of in your traces: the more services you include, the better picture you'll get of your requests. 
  * What things are needed to complete your request?
  * Identify the endpoints, services, and systems that are included to complete this request.
  * Identify the language for each service you want to include in traces.  
2. **Instrument services:** Instrumentation is the process that allows services to participate in traces. For New Relic agents where automatic instrumentation is available, it's just a matter of installing the agent and setting some configurations. For other tools, such as OpenTelemetry, instrumentation may require some code in your service.
3. **View traces:** After you instrument the services involved in the requests, generate some traffic in your application and then go to the New Relic UI to see the results.

## What tools do you want to use for instrumentation?

Now that you see the overall approach for setting up distributed tracing, select the links below for the way you want to instrument your services:

* [New Relic agents](#new-relic-agents) (including AWS Lambda and browser monitoring)
* [Integrations for third-party telemetry tools](#third-party-integrations)
* [Our Trace API](#trace-api)

## New Relic agents

We offer a range of agents to capture trace data from your applications:

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Product
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Language agents](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/apm-enable-distributed-tracing)
      </td>

      <td>
        See telemetry data from applications instrumented with our language-specific agents: C, Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

    </tr>

      <td>
        See Lambda function activity, and examine the functions in your traces.

        [Browser](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-pro-features/browser-data-distributed-tracing)

## New Relic integrations for third-party telemetry tools [#third-party-integrations]

If you are collecting telemetry data with selected open source telemetry tools, you can send your data to New Relic with our integrations:

* [OpenTelemetry](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-exporter)<Icon name="fe-opentelemetry" />
* [Istio](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/new-relics-istio-integration)<Icon name="fe-istio" />
* [Kamon](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/kamon-reporter)
* [OpenCensus](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integration-list/new-relics-opencensus-integration)<Icon name="fe-opencensus" />


<Callout variant="tip">
  To report your AWS X-Ray telemetry data, see our [AWS integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-x-ray-monitoring-integration).
</Callout>

## Set up your own solution with our Trace API [#trace-api]

Send data from your telemetry tool directly to New Relic without using an integration that exports the data.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Note that this may require more manual configuration than using an integration.
</Callout>
