Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. Requests might pass through various services to reach completion, and these services could be in a variety of places: containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, or on-premises. Distributed tracing provides a way for you to view the performance of the entire request across the different services so you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues.

Distributed tracing systems collect data as the requests travel from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request.

To capture this trace data distributed tracing uses instrumentation of each of the services in a request. This manual or automatic instrumentation allows distributed tracing to collect your trace data so you can troubleshoot issues across the entire system.

    Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace.
