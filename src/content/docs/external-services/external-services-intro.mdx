title: External services
metaDescription: "This is an introduction to the external services feature"
---
The external services feature allows you to look closely at the upstream and downstream activity of a single service. Those upstream or downstream external services may be your own services you instrumented, or they may refer to services you simply call in the course of a transaction. 

The external services feature is no longer just for New Relic APM agent users. It has expanded to include OpenTelemetry and now uses the power of distributed tracing to give you insights into service activity. The legacy external services feature is still available behind a UI toggle, but we recommend you try out the full power the expanded external services.  

This feature provides a combination of maps and graphs to help you:

* Find sources of latency and errors
* Assess the impact of latency to upstream callers
* Review transaction-level performance
* Find traces that involve the transactions you're interested in

To use the external services feature, you need a New Relic account with an installed APM agent with distributed tracing enabled. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a free account.

## Relationship to legacy external services [#legacy-external-services]

While you can still reach legacy external services by using the UI toggle, the main external services UI is now populated by data from distributed tracing. 
It still provides transaction data similar to legacy external services, but here are some key things you need to know about the expanded external services: 

  * **Dependency:** To use the external services feature, you need to enable distributed tracing on services that make calls to each other. 
  * **Compatibility:** Distributed tracing is not backwards compatible with legacy external services, so if you currently rely on legacy external services, please note that you will only have visibility into calls between services using the same protocol. 
  * **Data:** Unlike legacy external services, the transaction-level detail of distributed tracing is sampled instead of based on metrics. This sampled data links into distributed tracing, which can give you deeper insights into whatâ€™s driving the performance of the transactions.

## When would you use external services? [#when-to-use]

The external services feature is a tool you can use by itself to tune or troubleshoot a specific service, or you can use it as a starting point for additional troubleshooting with distributed tracing or even infrastructure agents. 

Let's say you're a developer responsible for service A:

  1. You get an alert that the average response time has increased anomalously.
  2. You look at your service and see that time spent in calls to other services has increased around the time of the alert.
  3. You drill into external services and see that the total time calling one service in particular, service B, increased just before the alert was fired.
  4. You select service B on the map, and see the performance of individual transactions in service A that call transactions in service B. You notice that one particular transaction on service A is slower than normal, and that it calls one transaction on service B.

Then, you can use distributed tracing to drill into more detail:

  1. Drill into distributed tracing and see in the trace that the calls in this transaction are doing something odd.
  2. Jump to that transaction on service B and see that it got slow after a deploy
