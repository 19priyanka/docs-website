### New Relic Language Exporters

New Relic has published a series of language specific exporters which are being deprecated. These exporters allowed applications to export OpenTelemetry data directly to New Relic without a [collector](#collector). The [native OTLP endpoint](#native-otlp) makes this strategy obsolete since it allows applications to export data to New Relic's proprietary endpoints.

The exporters and their maintenance status are as follows:

- [Go](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go) - To Be Archived Soon
- [Java](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-java) - Archived
- [Python](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-python) - Archived
- [.NET](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/src/NewRelic.OpenTelemetry) - To Be Archived Soon

If you are using any of these exporters, you should transition to using the OTLP exporter.

### New Relic Exporter [#newrelic-exporter]

Exporting data to New Relic using OTLP is preferred, however New Relic has published an exporter for the collector which will continue to be supported at least until native OTLP ingest is still in pre-release.

The [New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/newrelicexporter) can be found in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository.

The [OpenTelemetry Collector with New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/collector/nr-exporter-docker) example demonstrates what such a setup might look like.
