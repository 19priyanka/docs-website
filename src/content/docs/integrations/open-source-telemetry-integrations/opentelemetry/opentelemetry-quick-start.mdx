OpenTelemetry provides an API and SDK for most of the popular programming languages. Provided here are some resources to help you get started in instrumenting your services and configuring them to export telemetry data.

1. [Instrumenting your service with OpenTelemetry](#instrument)
2. [Configuring your service to export data](#send)

## Instrumenting your service with OpenTelemetry [#instrument]

To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually.

Go to the repository for your language to find examples and documentation for instrumenting your service.

## Configuring your service to export data via OTLP [#send]

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md), or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project, which describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data. This makes it a natural choice as a transport for OpenTelemetry data.

New Relic supports OTLP ingest (currently in pre-release). This allows you to export telemetry data directly to New Relic using an OTLP exporter.

If you are interested in the pre-release program, let us know by completing this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIJVEAYaP7TXe9LmQA64yIObGvt-nOiz5kXYsjxLBbvut_1A/viewform).

OpenTelemetry has defined the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for sending telemetry data. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to send data over OTLP.

You can configure the OTLP exporter to either send data directly to New Relic's OTLP endpoint or to an intermediate [OpenTelemetry Collector](#collector).

## OpenTelemetry Collector [#collector]

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. It can operate in multiple capacities: As a gateway, the collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. As an agent, the collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it.

Just like the language SDKs, you can configure your OpenTelemetry Collector with an [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlpexporter) to send data to New Relic.
