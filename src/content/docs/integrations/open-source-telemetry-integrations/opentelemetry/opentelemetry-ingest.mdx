## OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) [#otlp]

The [OpenTelemetry Protocol](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md), or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project, which describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data. This makes it a natural choice as a transport for OpenTelemetry data.

New Relic supports OTLP ingest (currently in pre-release). This allows you to export telemetry data directly to New Relic using an OTLP exporter.

If you are interested in the pre-release program, let us know by completing this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIJVEAYaP7TXe9LmQA64yIObGvt-nOiz5kXYsjxLBbvut_1A/viewform).

## OpenTelemetry Collector [#collector]

The [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. It can operate in multiple capacities: As a gateway, the collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. As an agent, the collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it.

Just like the language SDKs, you can configure your OpenTelemetry Collector with an [OTLP exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/exporter/otlpexporter) to send data to New Relic.

### New Relic Exporter [#newrelic-exporter]

Exporting data to New Relic using OTLP is preferred, however New Relic has published an exporter for the collector which will continue to be supported at least until native OTLP ingest is still in pre-release.

The [New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/newrelicexporter) can be found in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository.

The [OpenTelemetry Collector with New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/collector/nr-exporter-docker) example demonstrates what such a setup might look like.
