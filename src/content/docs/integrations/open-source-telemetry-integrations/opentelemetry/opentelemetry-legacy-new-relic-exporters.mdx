New Relic has published a number of exporters that are used to send OpenTelemetry data over New Relic's proprietary protocol. These exporters are being deprecated in favor of sending data to New Relic using the OpenTelemetry Protocol.

The exporters are listed here for reference. You should follows our [quick start guide](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-quick-start) to migrate from using these exporters.

## New Relic Language Exporters [#newrelic-language-exporters]

New Relic has published a series of language specific exporters which are being deprecated. These exporters allowed applications to export OpenTelemetry data directly to New Relic. The [New Relic OTLP endpoint](#native-otlp) makes this strategy obsolete since it allows applications to export data to New Relic's proprietary endpoints.

The exporters and their maintenance status are as follows:

- [Go](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-go) - To Be Archived Soon
- [Java](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-java) - Archived
- [Python](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporter-python) - Archived
- [.NET](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/src/NewRelic.OpenTelemetry) - To Be Archived Soon

## New Relic Exporter for the OpenTelemetry Collector [#newrelic-collector-exporter]

Exporting data to New Relic using OTLP is preferred, however New Relic has published an exporter for the collector which will continue to be supported at least until native OTLP ingest is still in pre-release.

The [New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter/newrelicexporter) can be found in the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repository.

The [OpenTelemetry Collector with New Relic Exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/collector/nr-exporter-docker) example demonstrates what such a setup might look like.

## Endpoint Configuraion for New Relic exporters [#h2-change-endpoints]

You can change the New Relic endpoints where you send your data. By default, New Relic OpenTelemetry exporters send data to these US data centers:

* Spans: [https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1](https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1)
* Metrics: [https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1](https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1)
* Logs: [https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1](https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1)

You may need to override these default endpoints to send data to the EU region or to use Infinite Tracing.

### EU region

To send telemetry data to New Relicâ€™s endpoints in the EU region, use the following:
