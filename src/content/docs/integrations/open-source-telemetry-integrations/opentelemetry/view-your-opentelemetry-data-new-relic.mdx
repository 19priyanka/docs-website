After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options:

* [Explorer](#explorer)
* [Data explorer and query builder](#query-builder)

## Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details [#explorer]

The New Relic **Explorer** tab is a good place to start gathering information about your services: 

1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Services - OpenTelemetry**:

    ![Screen capture showing how to filter for OpenTelemetry services.](./images/explorer_otel_services.png "Filter for OpenTelemetry to see only those entities.")

3. In the center pane, click the service you want to know more about, or find your service by entering the name in the top filter bar.

If you need help understanding how we display your data, see the following descriptions of the left-pane options in the UI.

### Summary page [#summary]

After you click on a service in the **Explorer** tab, you see the **Summary** page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper.

### Distributed tracing [#tracing]

In **Distributed tracing**, you can locate traces and examine span details:

1. To narrow the search for traces you want, you can run queries like these in the filter bar:
    * `service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME`
    * `trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID`
2. When you find an interesting trace, click on it to display a waterfall diagram showing the spans of the trace. 
3. Click on specific spans within the trace to display span details in the right panel.

For more ways to filter traces, see our [distributed tracing UI page](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui).
</Callout>

#### View spans with errors

After you click on a span in the trace waterfall view, you can see span errors in the right panel under **Error details**.

![Screenshot showing the right pane with Error details section](./images/view-span-errors.png "Screenshot showing the right pane with Error details section")

The error details are populated by spans containing `otel.status_code = ERROR` and display the content of `otel.status_description`.

To narrow your search for spans with errors, you can enter `otel.status_code = ERROR` directly in the distributed tracing filter bar.

#### View span events

If you send span events as described by the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#add-events), you can view them in the New Relic UI. Span events have two general types:
  * Exceptions 
  * Non-exceptions (for example, logs)

If you have span events, links for these appear in the right pane:

1. Click on a span in the waterfall view.
2. In the right pane, click **View span events**, or you can expand **Error details** and click the link at the bottom of the errors.

  ![Screenshot showing the right pane showing the two links for span events](./images/view-span-events.png "Screenshot showing the right pane showing the two links for span events")

3. When you're in span events and only want to view exceptions, toggle **Only show exceptions**.

![Screenshot showing span events and how you can filter just for exceptions](./images/span-events-exceptions.png "Screenshot showing span events and how you can filter just for exceptions")
            
<Callout variant="tip">
OpenTelemetry exceptions handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status. These exceptions are not necessarily associated with a span error status.
</Callout>

### Transactions [#trx]

Use **Transactions** to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the **Transaction Summary** page, select the transactions table.

### Databases [#databases]

The **Databases** page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts.

### Externals [#externals]

Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities.

### Logs [#logs]

The **Logs** page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our [OpenTelemetry and logging documentation](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-logs).

### Metrics explorer [#metric-explorer]

For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here.

## Data explorer and query builder [#query-builder]

Explore your metrics and traces using the [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer), or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see [Query your data](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/explore-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data) and [Introduction to NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).
