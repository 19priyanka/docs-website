## What is MLOps? [#mlops]

MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models.

MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring.

## The DAGsHub integration [#dagshub]

DAGsHub is a platform for data scientists and machine learning engineers to version and sync their data, models, experiments, and code. It allows you and your team to easily share, review and reuse your work, providing a GitHub-like experience for machine learning. DAGsHub is built on popular open-source tools and formats, making it easy to integrate with the tools you already use like New Relic.

New Relic now offers an integration with DAGsHub to monitor and analyze your machine learning training metrics in real-time. 

## Integrate DAGsHub with New Relic [#integrate]

Integrating DAGsHub and New Relic enables you to analyze and monitor machine learning training metrics in real-time. You can visualize your metrics in a [New Relic dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/), create custom metrics, and set [alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/introduction-alerts/) to notify you of events and incidents happening during your training runs.

In order to receive data from DAGsHub into New Relic, you need your account number and a special key which you can obtain as follows:

* Prerequisites: To log experiments to New Relic in real-time, you must first log metrics in real-time to DAGsHub. This is done using MLflow. To start, make sure to [sign up for a DAGsHub account](https://dagshub.com/user/sign_up), and create a new project. To learn how to log experiments with MLflow, check out [DAGsHub MLflow tracking documentation](https://dagshub.com/docs/reference/mlflow_tracking/).
* Get your **Account ID**: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the account menu, click **API keys**, and retrieve your New Relic account number. 
* Get your **Insert Key**: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the account menu, click on **Insight Insert Keys**, and retrieve your **x_insert_key**. 
* Connect to the DAGsHub repository: With your account id and your API key, access your **DAGsHub repository**. At the settings menu, go to the integrations page, and select New Relic. Now copy and paste your account ID and Insight insert key into the relevant fields, and click **Finish**. 

## Visualize metrics in New Relic dashboards [#visualize]
You can visualize all your training and evaluation metrics in real-time all in one place using New Relic dashboards. Take the following steps to generate insightful dashboards: 

* **Create a dashboard**: From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to **Dashboards**, then click the **Create a dashboard** button. 
* **Add metrics**: To add a metric, click on any of the boxes in your dashboard. 
  * Add a new chart clicking the **Add a new chart** button.
  * Write a [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) query to fetch information from all your sources. For example:
```SELECT latest(<metric_name>) FROM Metric TIMESERIES SINCE 1800 seconds ago```
  * Click **Run** to preview the chart results, and **Save** to add the chart to your dashboard.
* Create more NRQL queries: for more information on using NRQL and creating queries to track your data, visit NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions.
* Set up alerts notifications: Once you've added some metrics and created a dashboard, you can get alerted on your data. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart menu, then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one.
* Get notified: Once you've created an alerts condition, you can choose how you want to be notified. See our docs on how to set up notification channels.
* Correlate your incidents: In addition to notifications, you can use Incident Intelligence to correlate your incidents. See our docs on how to correlate incidents using decisions.

You’ve now successfully integrated New Relic with DAGsHub. Newly created alerts are correlated with your New Relic alerts, and you'll see data about newly reported predictions.
