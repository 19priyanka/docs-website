## What is MLOps?

MLOps stands for machine-learning operations.

The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) has become the leading investment in companies across the tech industry. As more companies hop on board, the gap between data science teams developing these ML models and DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models is increasingly becoming more challenging. 

MLOps allows teams to alleviate these challenges by providing a technological backbone for managing the machine learning lifecycle through automation and scalability. This allows for a seamless collaboration between data teams and DevOp teams ultimately leading to innovative solutions through the creation of sophisctated ML models, continued development and testing, and consistent operational and monitoring of the software. 


## Integration with Algorithmia

After deploying ML models into production, tracking model performance is an underestimated challenge for ML practitioners. Without rigorous observability capabilities, organizations risk failure to react to changes in the model input or output, or the model’s ability to capture the relation between these two.  

Since New Relic’s cloud-based observability infrastructure already helps instrument, analyze, troubleshoot, and optimize your entire software stack, Algorithmia is the perfect solution to collect model performance data and connect with New Relic’s monitoring tools - allowing for a smooth integration for business and operational management. 

By sending your model performance metrics from Algorithmia Insights to New Relic and having real-time monitoring for your algorithms, you can explore your Metrics data with user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your algorithms for faster and more efficient troubleshooting.
