## Problem [#logs-versions]

You are getting the message **`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`**.

## Solution

You need to ensure your signed certificates are properly configured. To do so, use the following variables in the `DaemonSet` portion of your manifest to set the `.pem` file:

```
- name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR 
  value: <var>YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR</var> 
- name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE  
  value: <var>YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME</var>
```

_YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env`_
