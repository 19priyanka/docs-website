title: Manage vulnerabilities as a developer
---

This document will cover: 
    - Maintain a single or a few healthy applications/services
    - Identify the most urgent vulnerabilities in your software stack
    - Understand the severity of vulnerabilities
    - Surface tasks from your security team in your daily workflow so it's easy to deliver more secure software with less toil.

If this workflow doesn't sound like you, check out our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a security team](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow).

## Prerequisites

Vulnerability data sent through [one of our integrations](/docs/vulnerability-management/integrations/overview).

## Maintain the vulnerability health of your application 

New Relic vulnerability management gives you a curated view of the status of vulnerabilities within your tech stack. Once vulnerability data starts flowing into New Relic, you can access your data through various scoped views. 

To monitor the health of specific applications or services, use our entity scoped view by navigating to **[newrelic.com](https://newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM and services** > select an entity > then select **Security** under the **Triage** tab. For a larger scope, see our document on [managing vulnerabilities as a security team](/docs/vulnerability-management/security-workflow).
