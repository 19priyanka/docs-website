[SAP&reg;](https://www.sap.com/) technology is critical to drive your key business processes. Issues related to your SAP systems can cause inefficiencies and interruptions that cost time and money to pinpoint and resolve. This in turn can impact your ability to generate revenue or deliver your products and services.

Using New Relic, you can monitor your SAP systems with a centralized view of your infrastructure, application, and business processes. This helps your IT teams to better support the business with early awareness and faster resolutions.

## How the New Relic SAP integration works [#how]

Use the New Relic integration with SAP SE to:

* **Get data from multiple sources.** We present your data from multiple SAP systems in your organization, as well as from non-SAP systems or individual components.
* **See performance and overall health data in one place.** Your telemetry metrics, events, logs, and traces all come together in a central, common view within our UI.
* **Relate relevant data to business processes.** We tag your data so that you can monitor your infrastructure and applications from the viewpoint of your corresponding business process.
* **Visualize and share the data with teams.** By querying and seeing relevant data in our customizable charts and dashboards, your IT team can more quickly identify the root cause and resolve problems.
* **Prevent problems before they occur.** Use our advanced alerting functionality to be notified about problems before they impact your customers.

## Why choose our SAP integration [#why]

If you are a medium to large enterprise organization, you need reliable SAP tools to manage your business operations and customer relations. Why choose the New Relic SAP integration? 

### Easier to onboard

Unlike other APM competitors who also offer SAP observability, we leverage your existing SAP data sources instead of using intrusive agents within SAP systems. We provide an agentless approach to monitoring SAP servers with our SAP "connector." And every component of our comprehensive monitoring solution (SAP or non-SAP) is developed and supported by New Relic, not by third-party vendors.

### Leverages your existing SAP investments

You can continue to use any existing data sources with our integration. The data we monitor is automatically put in context of your organization's business process.

### No version-specific updates needed

Some SAP solutions apply only to specific versions or situations, which results in time-consuming, frequent updates and coordination. Unlike those solutions, our SAP integration uses your data source, so if that changes, we simply use your new source.
