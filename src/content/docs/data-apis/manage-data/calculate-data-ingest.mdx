For New Relic organizations on the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), several factors impact your costs: which edition you're on ([Standard, Pro, or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing)), how many billable users you have, and how much data you ingest. 

Figuring out your data ingestion is probably the most complex part of the equation because it can (and will) vary. This data calculation doc should be useful if you're new to New Relic One pricing, or if you're expanding your New Relic monitoring. To aid you in this, we've provided [this data-sizing spreadsheet](link) to help you estimate your ingest and associated costs, such as data retention. **Note that the spreadsheet is only an estimate**: it shouldn’t be considered a binding contract.

This section focuses only on ingest sizing. Note that you get 100 GBs of data ingest per month for free. If you want more information about pricing, you’ll find it [New Relic One pricing details](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing). 


## Get accurate sizing [#accurate-sizing]

We analyzed 10,000 existing New Relic organizations of various sizes to arrive at the ingest rates we use in our calculations. That said, you’ll get the most precise estimate by running a test installation to establish a consumption baseline. Ingest rates vary from one organization to the next, based primarily on telemetry sources, features you use, and app behaviors. 

For the most precise sizing:

* If you’re creating a new New Relic organization, create a test installation using a representative environment similar to what you’ll need moving forward. Then use the baseline ingest from the trial to extrapolate what your full environment would require. To do this, [create a new free account](https://newrelic.com/signup), and use one of our [instant observability options](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability/) to get started with observing data. 
* If you’re an existing customer, use actual consumption information from the [data management hub](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data/#where-to-find-the-data-management-hub) or by [querying your data ingest](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts) to estimate new or added ingest.
* Know your use cases so you can include factors that affect ingest rates. Your estimates will often be general and sized as high, medium, or low ingest rates. 
* Use the discovery questions and guidance in the following sections to forecast ingest.

Note that the [spreadsheet](?link) is most useful for basic scenarios where you know the number of application performance monitoring (APM) agents, hosts, and logs you use.

## Work through the sizing calculator [#work-sizing-calculator]
The following sections walk you through the data-sizing spreadsheet. Each section describes the type of information you need to provide and how to measure your ingest for those data types.

### Sizing example

For a new customer who has no additional users, 8TB of log data stored for 13 months, 120 hosts, and 80 JVMs, this is how the calculation works out.
``` 
APM: 80 * 5.4 GB/mo = 432 GB/mo
Infra: 120 * 5 GB/mo = 600 GB/mo
Logs: 8 TB / 13 mo = 615 GB/mo
Included in free tier: 100 GB/mo
Retention: 25¢ + 12 mo * 5¢ = 85¢ GB/mo

Total: 615 GB + 600 GB + 432 GB - 100 GB = 
1547 GB/mo * 85¢ * 12 mo = $15,780/yr
```

Ingest rates are measured per [agent](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#agent), not per [host](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#host). You might have multiple agents monitoring a single host.

In this section, you estimate whether you have low, medium, or high ingest rates from APM agents. We’ve built an average of the data volume for all APM agent types into the calculator. When filling out this section, consider these questions:
* How many APM agents will you deploy?
* What types of applications will you monitor? Understanding how the application is used and the application complexity is important. For example, e-commerce apps will have much higher throughput than an internal application.
* Will you use features that contribute to higher ingest rates? See the criteria questions that follow for more detail.

## Criteria for calculating ingest rates per APM agent

In general, use higher ingest rates for applications that are integration/business tiers, large business-to-consumer (B2C) sites, or have significant custom instrumentation or metrics. That means, select “high” in these cases:

* For app behaviors and environments where you expect high throughput and a high number of errors; and if the app is in a production environment.
* For complex app architectures. For example, a single front-end request spawns multiple back-end requests. 
* If you have a high number of key transactions.
* If you have custom instrumentation and [APM metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics).
* For highly attributed transactions.

### Add APM agent ingest to the spreadsheet

1. Add the number of APM agents that you will monitor.
2. Approximate the amount of ingest you’ll need for your agents and select one of the options. In general, if you’re signing up for New Relic at the entry-level Standard edition, you can probably select "low":  
  * Low: Choose low if 0-1 of the above criteria apply.  
  * Medium: Choose medium if 1-3 of the above criteria apply.
  * High: Choose high if more than 3 of the above criteria apply.

### Tune your APM ingest 

If you want to reduce the volume or noise of your APM ingest, you have some options:
* Configure the [sampling rate](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#Transaction_Events) for transaction events.
* [Set appropriate Apdex scores](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings/), for example, for frequency of traces.
* Optimize [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation/) and/or [custom metrics](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics/).

New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a [lightweight](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-agent-performance-overhead/) executable file that collects [data about your hosts](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events/). Sizing your infrastructure agent ingest depends on the number of integrations you have, and their size.  

## Criteria for calculating infrastructure agent ingest

When calculating the volume of your infrastructure ingest, take into account:
* How many infrastructure agents do you need? 
* Which integrations contribute to higher ingest rates? The following are some approximate sizes. You should also take the size of your environments into account. If they’re very large, for example, these rates might not be accurate.
    * [On-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/get-started/introduction-host-integrations) (low)
    * Cloud integrations (low to medium)
    * Kubernetes integrations (medium to high)

### Add infrastructure agent ingest to the spreadsheet

1. At step 3 in the spreadsheet, add your number of infrastructure agents. To determine this, decide how many hosts you’ll run infrastructure agents on.
2. In step 4, assign a size for the volume of your infrastructure:
* Start with your base ingest rate as "low" if you will have only a few on-host integrations.
* Adjust to medium or high depending on how many and how high the volume of your integrations. Consider whether you have cloud integrations with large footprints, or a large number of database on-host integrations, or multiple or large Kubernetes clusters. For example:
    *  If running two or more low or medium impact integrations such as cloud or on-host integrations, choose **medium** ingest rate.
    * If running all three types of integrations (oh-host, cloud, containers) or observing really large Kubernetes environments, choose **high** for your ingest rates.

### Tune your infrastructure agent ingest

You can reduce the volume or noise of your infrastructure ingest in one of the following ways:
* Adjust [sampling rate](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#samples-variables) for network, storage, and system events.
* Adjust polling intervals for on-host and cloud integrations.
* Manage [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration/#install).

For this section, you add an estimated amount of ingest in gigabytes. 

## Criteria for calculating log data ingest

When estimating log data ingest:

* Use current logs volume. For example:
    * Pull information from existing ELK, Splunk, or Sumo storage and divide by total months that data is currently retained to get a per-month rate.
    * Multiply your average log file size by the number of logs you use, and extrapolate to get a per-month rate.
* Subtract security (PCI/HIPAA) and audit logs.
    * Generally, 40-50% of current ELK, Splunk, and Sumo storage is used for troubleshooting.
* Understand your retention requirements.
    * Typically, troubleshooting logs are not that valuable after 30 days of retention.

### Add log data ingest to the spreadsheet

* In section 5, add your estimated monthly log data ingest, in GB. 

### Tune your logs ingest

* Use the log forwarder to filter log events on the sending side.
* Use [data dropping rules](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/) to control ingest on the New Relic receiving side. Events dropped this way do not count toward consumption.

  </Collapser>

  
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="add-retention"
    title="Add additional retention"
  >
You can add or subtract from the baseline retention settings for each data source. To learn about retention and the baselines, see [Data retention](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention). 

## Retention considerations 

* For each additional month (30 days) of retention, the cost is $0.05 per GB ingested per month.
* Retention is added evenly across all namespaces up to a maximum of 395 days. Retention cannot be extended for just one namespace (for example, just logs or custom events). The increased rate is applied to all ingested data.

### Add additional retention to spreadsheet
* In section 6 of the spreadsheet, select the additional months of retention that you want.

  </Collapser>

</CollapserGroup>

## Finish the estimate

When you complete the extended retention section, the total estimated price is displayed in the **Calculator metrics** section of the spreadsheet. This rough estimate also includes five percent that is added to the total ingest to cover browser monitoring ingest, which is typically low for most new customers. 

## Additional potential costs

Because this spreadsheet was designed for new users, we have included the most common costs. For example, we haven’t provided cost estimating for browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, or network performance monitoring. Synthetic monitors don’t contribute to ingest. But be aware that high amounts of ingest in these other areas can impact costs.
