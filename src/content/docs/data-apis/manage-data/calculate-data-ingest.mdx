Several factors impact your New Relic One costs: which edition you're on ([Free, Standard, Pro, or Enterprise](https://newrelic.com/pricing)), how many billable users you have, and how much data you ingest. Figuring out your data ingestion is probably the most complex part of the equation because it can (and will) vary.

To help you calculate the size of your ingest, we’ve provided this sizing guide. Use the [attached spreadsheet](link) as a scratchpad along with the information in this guide. It will help you estimate your ingest and associated costs, such as data retention. It’s only an estimate though, and shouldn’t be treated as a binding contract.

This section focuses only on ingest sizing. If you want more information about pricing, you’ll find it [in this section of the docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/). Basically, all pricing builds on our free tier, which consists of the following: 

* A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization).
* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month.
* One full platform user for Standard edition accounts, and unlimited basic users.

This sizing guide is useful for people who are new to New Relic One, or who are expanding their New Relic One instance into new groups or products.

## Get accurate sizing

We analyzed 10,000 existing New Relic commercial and enterprise accounts to develop the ingest rates provided in these calculations. That said, you’ll get the most precise estimate by running a test installation to establish a consumption baseline. Ingest rates vary from one user to the next, based on telemetry sources, features you use, and app behaviors, primarily. 

For the most precise sizing:

* If you’re a new user, create a test installation using a representative environment similar to what you’ll need moving forward. Then use the baseline ingest from the trial to extrapolate what your full environment would require. To do this, [create a new free account](https://newrelic.com/signup), and use one of our [instant observability options](https://developer.newrelic.com/instant-observability/) to get started with observing data. 
* If you’re an existing customer, use actual consumption information from the [Data Management Hub](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-your-data/#where-to-find-the-data-management-hub) or `NrConsumption` tables to estimate new or added ingest.
* Know your use cases so you can include factors that affect ingest rates. Your estimates will often be general and sized as high, medium, or low ingest rates. 
* Use the discovery questions and guidance in the following sections to forecast ingest.

Note that the spreadsheet is most useful for basic scenarios where you know the number of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) agents, infra hosts, and logs you use.

## Work through the sizing calculator
The following sections walk you through the data sizing scratchpad. Each section describes the type of information you need to provide and how to measure your ingest for those data types.

### Sizing example

For a new customer who has no additional users, 8TB of log data stored for 13 months, 120 hosts, and 80 JVMs, this is how the calculation works out.
``` 
APM: 80 * 5.4 GB/mo = 432 GB/mo
Infra: 120 * 5 GB/mo = 600 GB/mo
Logs: 8 TB / 13 mo = 615 GB/mo
Included in free tier: 100 GB/mo
Retention: 25¢ + 12 mo * 5¢ = 85¢ GB/mo

Total: 615 GB + 600 GB + 432 GB - 100 GB = 
1547 GB/mo * 85¢ * 12 mo = $15,780/yr
```

Ingest rates are measured per [agent](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#agent), not per [host](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#host). You might have multiple agents per host.

In this section, you estimate whether you have low, medium, or high ingest rates from APM agents. We’ve built an average of the data volume for all APM agent types into the calculator. When filling out this section, consider these questions:
* How many APM agents will you deploy?
* What types of applications will you monitor? Understanding how the application is used and the application complexity is important. For example, e-commerce apps will have much higher throughput than an internal application.
* Will you use features that contribute to higher ingest rates? See the criteria questions that follow for more detail.

## Criteria for calculating ingest rates per APM agent

In general, use higher ingest rates for applications that are integration/business tiers, large business-to-consumer (B2C) sites, or have significant custom instrumentation or metrics. That means, select “high” in these cases:

* For app behaviors and environments where you expect high throughput and a high number of errors; and if the app is in a production environment.
* For complex app architectures. For example, a single front-end request spawns multiple back-end requests. 
* If you have a high number of key transactions.
* If you have custom instrumentation and [APM metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics).
* For highly attributed transactions.

### Add APM agent ingest to the spreadsheet

1. Add the number of APM agents that you will monitor.
2. Approximate the amount of ingest you’ll need for your agents and select one of the options. In general, if you’re a new user, you can likely select low. 
* Low: Choose low if 0-1 of the above criteria apply.  
* Medium: Choose medium if 1-3 of the above criteria apply.
* High: Choose high if more than 3 of the above criteria apply.

### Tune your APM ingest

If you want to reduce the volume or noise of your APM ingest, you have some options:
* Configure the [sampling rate](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#Transaction_Events) for transaction events.
* [Set appropriate APDEX scores](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings/), for example, for frequency of traces.
* Optimize [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation/) and/or [custom metrics](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics/).

 New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a [lightweight](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/infrastructure-agent-performance-overhead/) executable file that collects [data about your hosts](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-events/). Sizing your infrastructure agent ingest depends on the number of integrations you have, and their size.  

## Criteria for calculating infrastructure agent ingest

When calculating the volume of your infrastructure ingest, take into account:
* How many infrastructure agents do you need? 
* Which integrations contribute to higher ingest rates? The following are some approximate sizes. You should also take the size of your environments into account. If they’re very large, for example, these rates might not be accurate.
    * On-host integrations (low)
    * Cloud integrations (low to medium)
    * Kubernetes integrations (medium to high)

### Add infrastructure agent ingest to the spreadsheet

1. At step 3 in the spreadsheet, add your number of infrastructure agents. To determine this, decide how many hosts you’ll run infrastructure agents on.
2. In step 4, assign a size for the volume of your infrastructure:
* Start with low as your base ingest rate or if you will have a few on-host integrations.
* Adjust to medium or high depending on how many and how high the volume of your integrations. Consider whether you have cloud integrations with large footprints, or a large number of database on-host integrations, or multiple or large Kubernetes clusters. For example:
    *  If running two or more low or medium impact integrations such as cloud or on-host integrations, choose **medium** ingest rate.
    * If running all three types of integrations (oh-host, cloud, containers) or observing really large Kubernetes environments, choose **high** for your ingest rates.

### Tune your infrastructure agent ingest

You can reduce the volume or noise of your infrastructure ingest in one of the following ways:
* Adjust [sampling rate](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/infrastructure-agent-configuration-settings#samples-variables) for network, storage, and system events.
* Adjust polling intervals for on-host and cloud integrations.
* Manage [Kubernetes events integration](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/install-kubernetes-events-integration/#install).

For this section, you add an estimated amount of ingest in gigabytes. 

## Criteria for calculating log data ingest

When estimating log data ingest:

* Use current logs volume. For example:
    * Pull information from existing ELK, Splunk, or Sumo storage and divide by total months that data is currently retained to get a per month rate.
    * Multiply your average log file size by the number of logs you use, and extrapolate to get a per month rate.
* Subtract security (PCI/HIPAA) and audit logs.
    * Generally, 40-50% of current ELK, Splunk, and Sumo storage is used for troubleshooting.
* Understand your retention requirements.
    * Typically, troubleshooting logs are not that valuable after 30 days of retention.

### Add log data ingest to the spreadsheet

* In section 5, add your estimated monthly log data ingest, in GB. 

### Tune your logs ingest

* Use the log forwarder to filter log events on the sending side.
* Use [data dropping rules](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/drop-data-using-nerdgraph/) to control ingest on the New Relic receiving side. Events dropped this way do not count toward consumption.

How many people need to fix code and troubleshoot issues in your New Relic implementation? This is your number of Pro or Enterprise users. The rest of provisioned users are basic users ($0).

## Criteria for selecting user types: Pro or Enterprise

Will the additional users from section 6 be Pro or Enterprise users? You can estimate this based on the kind of account you have or intend to have. For example:
* Choose **Enterprise** if your users will manage things like automated user management (AUM), Support SLA, full governance control, or FedRamp.
* Choose **Pro** if your users will manage the New Relic Edge app, retention rates, SAML, support tickets, and more.

### Add users to the spreadsheet

1. In section 6, add the number of people who will need to work on your New Relic implementation. 
2. In section 7, select the user type for the number of users you selected in section 6. (Pro is the default.)
3. In section 8, add the number of basic users. That is users who only need to review New Relic dashboards. These users, are free.

  <Collapser

    id="add-retention"
    title="Add additional retention"
  >
You can add or subtract from the baseline retention settings for each data source. To learn the baselines, see the [data retention documentation](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-retention/). 

## Retention considerations

* For each addtional month (30 days) of retention, the cost is $0.05 per GB ingested per month.
* Retention is added evenly across all event namespaces up to a maximum of 395 days. Retention cannot be extended for just one event namespace (for example, just logs or custom events). The increased rate is applied to all ingested data.

### Add additional retention to spreadsheet
* In section 9, select the additional months of retention that you need.

  </Collapser>

## Finish the estimate

When you complete the extended retention section, the total estimated price is displayed in the Calculator metrics section of the spreadsheet. This rough estimate also includes fiver percent that is added to the total ingest to cover Browser ingest, which is typically low for most new customers. 

## Additional potential costs

Because this spreadsheet was designed for new users, we have included the most common costs. For example, we haven’t provided cost estimating for Browser, Mobile, or network performance monitoring. Synthetics don’t contribute to ingest. But be aware that high amounts of ingest in those areas can impact costs.
