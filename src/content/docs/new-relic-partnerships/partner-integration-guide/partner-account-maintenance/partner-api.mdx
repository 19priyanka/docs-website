Our Partnership API allows New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings.

## Requirements [#requirements]

The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: [partners](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) (managed service providers, resellers) and [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). 

These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2.

Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership ability requires prior setup and approval by New Relic representatives. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID.

Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as [customer partnerships](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships) have restrictions that follow. 

### Customer partnership restrictions [#customer-restrictions]

If your New Relic account is set up as a [customer partnership](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions/#partnerships), there are some restrictions in place for our newer pricing plan and user model:

* **Pricing plan.** If you’re on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans), you can’t use the Partnership API's [subscription object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-subscription-object/) or the [NerdGraph Provisioning API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/tutorials/provisions-your-subscriptions-nerdgraph/), because those govern our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans). 
* **User model.** If your New Relic account has been converted to be entirely on the [New Relic One account/user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). This has two main impacts:  
  * You can't use the [user object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object/) because it governs users on the original user model. You'd manage users with [these user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).
  * You can use the [account object](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-account-object/) but you can't add users via the `users` field because that adds original user model users. You'd manage users with [these user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-managing-users/).

## Things you can do with the API [#functions]

The following functions are supported:

**Account:**

* Create new
* Show
* Update
* Cancel
* Set primary admin
* Show usage

**Users:**

For accounts with users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), you can:

* Add user access to account
* Remove user access from account

**Subscription:** 

For accounts on the [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans), you can change various subscription terms.

## Initial API call [#initial-call]

The initial API call for all account-level interactions is to "create account." This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the `account_id`. All of the other calls in the Partnership API require the `account_id` as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the `account_id`, and associate it with the users' partner account record.

## Password complexity and the API [#password]

Starting with v2 of the Partnership API, passwords passed as part of an account creation call will be required to meet the following complexity minimums:

* 8 to 50 characters in length
* Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters
* Cannot contain spaces
* Must contain at least 1 letter
* Must contain at least 1 number or special character
