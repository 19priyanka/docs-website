## Email notifications 

Want to be in the know when an error group has been assigned to you? We got you! When an error group is assigned to a user, the user immediately receives an email with the error group's details. 

Email notifications are triggered when:

* An error group is assigned and unassigned to a user.
* The state of an error group has changed. The user assigned to the error group will be notified.

Email notifications are currently sent to members of your team. If there's a new member you want to include, be sure to [invite them to the team](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2020/11/invite-teammate/) first. 

### Unsubscribe 

Any email you receive includes an unsubscribe option (see image below). If you opt to unsubscribe, you won't receive any more notifications from errors inbox.
