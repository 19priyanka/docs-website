Review and manage how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). Keep data for shorter periods to protect sensitive information or keep data for longer periods to notice trends over time. Retention settings range from 8 to 395 days depending on the data's `source` and `namespace` classifications in New Relic.

Managing data retention can be accessed through the **Data retention** page on your NRDB. Read on to learn about:

## Adjust retention values [#adjust-retention]

You can adjust your retention periods to better support your data needs and meet data compliance requirements.

Reduce your contracted retention values to optimize query performance, or increase retention for some data types to support more granular analysis over longer periods of time. 

The ability to edit data retention periods differs depending on your [edition of New Relic](https://newrelic.com/pricing):

**Standard edition**: Your data retention is fixed
- Data retention falls between 8 and 395 days (about 13 months), depending on which capabilities of the New Relic platform you’re using. 
- Prescribed retention levels ensure that you can explore your data and experience the value of New Relic. 
- If you need to raise some of the retention limits for your particular business needs, you can purchase additional retention.

**Pro or Enterprise**: Your data retention is flexible
- You can adjust your telemetry data retention settings even after finalizing a contracted retention.

### Reduce retention values [#reducing-retention]

We have safeguards in place to ensure you don't accidentally delete data, but this also means that reducing retention values isn't a good strategy for quickly [removing data](#data-deletion).

When you reduce the number of days that specific data sources are retained, existing data of that source type won't immediately disappear and might be visible and returned in queries for up to several weeks. Your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration.

That said, your change is registered in the system within 12 hours and new data of the adjusted source type will be retained for the new duration. 

<Callout variant="tip">
Note that reducing data retention below your contracted retention values will not reduce New Relic’s data ingest charges. Conversely, increasing retention for targeted telemetry data types is likely to trigger a conversation with New Relic about adjusting your data ingest charges.
</Callout>

## Copy retention values [#copy-retention]

If you have permission to edit retention settings, you can also copy retention values from one child account to other child accounts under the same parent account. To do this from within a child account, select the Copy settings to other accounts link, and then select the child accounts you want to apply the retention values to.

![image of child accounts to copy retention values to](./images/copy-data-retention.png "Copy retention values")

<figcaption>
  Select the child accounts you want to copy retention values to.
</figcaption>


## Delete data [#data-deletion]

Once [telemetry data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its [data retention period](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-retention/#adjust-retention) ends. 

If you need to delete data, contact your New Relic account representative. 


## Account inheritance [#account-structure]

For organizations that have a [parent/child account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure), child accounts inherit the data retention settings from their parent account. If a child account has its own specified data retention settings, the child’s settings override inherited settings from their parent account.


## Metric data rollup [#metric-data-rollup]

[Metric timeslice data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#metrics) is generated by APM (both custom metrics and out-of-the-box metrics), mobile, and browser agents. Metric timeslice data is aggregated:
- Firstly in 1-minute rollups retained for 8 days.
- Secondly  in 1-hour roll-ups for 90 days, with key metric data in turn being stored indefinitely.

We meter on the size of the initial 1-minute rollup, not on any of the subsequent rollups. Read on to learn the key metrics by product.


### Key metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile

Here are the key metrics that are stored indefinitely.

    </tr>

</table>

### Metric raw data

Metric raw data is handled differently for:
- APM
- Prometheus remote-write API
- Metrics functionality of the Telemetry SDK
- Integrations built on the Telemetry SDK

Raw sub-minute metric data is stored for 30 days. Beyond 30 days, 1-minute resolution roll-up events are created and retained for 13 months. Like metric timeslice data, we meter and bill on the size of the raw ingest, not the subsequent rollups.

Metric retention periods are not editable.
