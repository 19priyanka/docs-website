title: Use NrIntegrationError event to understand data ingest problems
metaDescription: Use the NrIntegrationError event to understand problems with ingest, integration with New Relic, and limits. 
---

Use New Relic's `NrIntegrationError` event to understand problems related to data ingest and feature configuration.  

## What is NrIntegrationError used for? [#overview]

Our `NrIntegrationError` event is used to record error messages related to: 

* Exceeding data limits 
* Malformed data
* Configuration issues

You can run queries to analyze the errors that are being generated. You can also set up alerts to be notified when specific types of errors, or quantities of errors, occur. 

The primary way `NrIntegrationError` events are categorized is by the `newRelicFeature` attribute. `newRelicFeature` values include: 

* `Metrics` indicates an issue with the Metric API or the tools that use that API.
* `Event API` indicates an issue with the Event API. 
* `Distributed Tracing` indicates an issue with distributed tracing (`Span`) data. 

For attribute definitions, see the [data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrIntegrationError). 

## Query and alert [#query-alert]

You can query `NrIntegrationError` events using [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language), and set up [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions) to get notified when issues happen. 

Here's an example query that will show Event API ingest issues from the last week, with up to 100 results: 

```
SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100
```

Here's a similar query that shows issues with the Metric API: 

```
SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100
```

Here's a similar query that shows issues with distributed tracing data: 

```
SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO LIMIT 100
```

Here's a query showing a count of events over time: 

```
SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' TIMESERIES
```

If you want to see the structure of this event, you can use `keyset()`, like this: 

```
FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT keyset()
```

## Tutorials and examples [#use-cases]

Here are links to docs that go into more detail about how `NrIntegrationError` can be used. 

### Ingest APIs [#ingest-related]

Here are `NrIntegrationError`-related docs for our core ingest APIs. Note that these events are generated not just for direct use of these APIs but for any New Relic tools that use those APIs for data ingest: 

* Metric API: 
    * [Troubleshoot Metric API ingest](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/metric-api/troubleshoot-nrintegrationerror-events)
* Event API: 
    * See [parsing errors](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/#errors-parsing) and [tips for troubleshooting event reporting](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api/#nrIntegration).
* Log API:
    * See [No log data appears](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui).
* Trace API: 
    * [Response validation](/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/trace-api-general-requirements-limits/#response-validation)
    * [Troubleshoot missing data](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/trace-api/troubleshooting-missing-trace-api-data)

### Data limits [#limit-related]

Limit-related docs: 
* [View the limits UI](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/view-system-limits) (`NrIntegrationError` is used to create these charts)
* [Limit-related query examples](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/query-limits)  

### Specific agents and integrations [#agent-related]

* APM agent: [Config mismatch](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/agent-nrintegrationerrors-appear-insights)
* [StatsD](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/statsd-monitoring-integration-version-2)
* Prometheus: [OpenMetrics errors](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/troubleshooting/rate-limit-errors-prometheus-integration) | [Remote write errors](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-remote-write/remote-write-errors-error-messages)
