title: Troubleshoot using NrIntegrationError event
metaDescription: Use the NrIntegrationError event to understand problems with ingest, integration with New Relic, and limits. 
---

Use New Relic's `NrIntegrationError` event to understand problems related to data ingest and feature configuration.  

## What is NrIntegrationError used for? [#overview]

Our `NrIntegrationError` event is used to record error messages related to: 

* Exceeding data limits 
* Malformed data
* Configuration issues

[See more about use cases.](#use-cases)

## Query and alert [#query-alert]

You can query `NrIntegrationError` events using [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language), and set up [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions) to get notified when issues happen. 

Here's an example query that will show issues with Event API data ingest: 

```
SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API'
```

If you want to see the structure of this event, you can use `keyset()`, like this: 

```
FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT keyset()
```

For attribute definitions, see the [data dictionary](/attribute-dictionary/?event=NrIntegrationError). 

## Use cases [#use-cases]

Here are links to docs that go into more detail about how `NrIntegrationError` can be used.
