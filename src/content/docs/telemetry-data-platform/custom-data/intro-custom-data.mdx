If you want to get the most out of New Relic, you will eventually want to send in custom data to help you get insights about your unique environment and the unique challenges your organization faces. 


## Why report custom data? [#why]

New Relic provides a [wide variety of integrations and agents to report data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks/) from your apps, hosts, and services to our platform. But organizations that want to optimize their observability and performance monitoring will want to send in new sources of data that our solutions don't report out-of-the-box. 

For example, you might decide that you need an entirely new type of [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) that's triggered when a specific action is taken in your application. Or you might want to add a custom [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#attribute) (for example, `userId`) to an already reporting event.  

Once you report custom data, you can then [query that data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/), make charts from it, and use those charts to build dashboards. There's no limit to what you can do when combining our out-of-the-box default data with your custom data, and the organizations that use New Relic the most almost all have implemented custom data. 

This doc will explain some common custom data use cases, some of the things to consider when implementing custom data, and some of the more common ways to accomplish this. 


## Custom events and attributes: example use cases [#examples]

Two popular custom data solution are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. 

https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/custom-events/report-custom-event-data

Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. 

### Using custom attributes 

Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. 

**Adding business context:**

Business context might include: 
* Customer token
* Customer market segment
* Customer value classification
* Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem
* User/product/account privilege context

**Adding operational context:**

Operational context might include: 
* Which feature flags were used
* What datastore was accessed
* What cache was accessed
* What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning)

### Using custom events 

Event data is one of New Relic's four core [data types](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data): we recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by "event" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. 

The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples:  

* An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. 
* An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration.

## Considerations before adding custom data [#overview]

Before sending in custom data, you should first consider these points: 

1. See if there's an available New Relic solution that will bring in the data you need. Read [our doc about getting data in](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks), and peruse [[all of our integrations and agents](https://newrelic.com/integrations). Also consider whether [adding tags to your data](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/) might help you solve a problem.  
2. Get familiar with our UI and the data being reported. Too much unnecessary data makes analysis more difficult, so first you'll want to see if you can accomplish what you need with the data you already have. To do this, you should explore the New Relic platform to ensure you understand it, read about [our types of data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) to understand what types of data we have and what type of data you may need, and [query your reported data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) to see what's available. 
3. When you've decided that you need custom data, you'll want to read the docs for the New Relic tools that you're using, to see if they provide ways to send the custom data you need. We do have [APIs and SDKs]**?? for reporting custom data, but those require some study to use and should be your last resort, used mainly for the most complex implementations. First you should see if you can configure a tool you're already using.
4. Make a plan. It's possible to overwhelm yourself with too much unnecessary data (and data ingest is a factor in [New Relic One pricing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing)), so you'll want to plan out what you're trying to accomplish and how the custom data will help you accomplish that. As part of that, you may also want to disable some default reporting: see [Manage data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-your-data/). 

Below are various ways to get custom data into New Relic, with some of the most common and popular methods near the top. 


## Tags [#tags]

Tags aren't technically a form of custom data, but they can help get more detail and insight into your already reported data. To learn more, see [Tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/). 

## Our agents: APM, browser, mobile, infrastructure [#agents]

Our agents give you APIs for adding custom events and attributes on top of what you're already reporting. For details, see [Send custom events and attributes](/docs/insights/event-data-sources/custom-events/report-custom-event-data/#ways).

Our APM, browser, and mobile agents also allow you to [report custom metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics/). 

## Event API [#event-api]

If you can't, or don't want to, use an agent to report custom events, you can use our [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api). Before using the Event API, you should [read about how we define event data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) and how it's used at New Relic. 


## Convert data to metrics [#events-to-metrics]

One way to customize data is to [transform events and other data types to metrics](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/convert-data-metrics/analyze-monitor-data-trends-metrics/. Metrics are aggregates of your data and are a better way to analyze and monitor trends over longer time periods.

This is one way to manage your data: [learn about other data management methods](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-your-data).

## Integrations [#integrations]

We have many integrations for specific services, like our [infrastructure integrations](/docs/integrations/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/) and our [open source telemetry integrations](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relics-open-source-telemetry-integrations). Not all of those allow the reporting of custom data, so you'll want to read the docs for those tools. 

## Synthetics [#synthetics]

If you're using [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/, you can create custom synthetic scripts, and [add custom attributes](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/add-custom-attributes-synthetic-monitoring-data/). 

## Build your own integration [#build]

If we don't have a tool that meets your needs, you can always build your own and report whatever data you want. 

* Our [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/telemetry-sdks-report-custom-telemetry-data/) are an open source set of language-specific API client libraries that send data to the New Relic platform. Our [open-source integrations for telemetry tools](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relics-open-source-telemetry-integrations/) (like Prometheus, Istio, and OpenCensus) were created using our Telemetry SDKs. You can use these SDKs to create your own telemetry data solutions.
* Our infrastructure monitoring [Flex tool](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration) comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. It's an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services and is easy to use.  
* Build a custom [New Relic One application](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application) that lives in New Relic, can be shared with your team or the public, and that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. You can use New Relic One apps to analyze New Relic data, or bring in whatever data you want.
