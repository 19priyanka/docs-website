metaDescription: "An introduction to reporting custom data to New Relic: why you'd want to do that, and how to start."
---

If you want to get the most out of New Relic, you will eventually want to send in custom data to help you get insights about your unique environment and the unique challenges your organization faces. 


## Why report custom data? [#why]

New Relic provides a [wide variety of integrations and agents to report data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks/) from your apps, hosts, and services to our platform. But organizations that want to optimize their observability and performance monitoring will want to send in new sources of data that our solutions don't report out-of-the-box. 

For example, you might decide that you need an entirely new type of [event](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#event-data) that's triggered when a specific action is taken in your application. Or you might want to add a custom [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#attribute) (for example, `userId`) to an already reporting event.  

Once you report custom data, you can then [query that data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/), make charts from it, and use those charts to build dashboards. There's no limit to what you can do when combining our out-of-the-box default data with your custom data, and the organizations that use New Relic the most almost all have implemented custom data. 

This doc will explain some common custom data use cases, some of the things to consider when implementing custom data, and some of the more common ways to accomplish this. 

## Considerations before adding custom data [#overview]

Before sending in custom data, you should first consider these points: 

1. **See if there's an available New Relic solution that will solve your problem.** Read [our doc about getting data in](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-data-ingest-apis-sdks), and peruse [all of our integrations and agents](https://newrelic.com/integrations). Also consider whether [adding tags to your data](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/) might help you solve a problem.  
2. **Get familiar with New Relic and the data being reported.** Too much unnecessary data makes analysis more difficult, so first you'll want to see if you can accomplish what you need with the data you already have. To do this, you should explore the New Relic platform to ensure you understand it, read about [our types of data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types) to understand what types of data we have and what type of data you may need, and [query your reported data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/understand-data/introduction-querying-new-relic-data/) to see what's available. 
3. **Read the docs for the tools you're using.** When you've decided that you need custom data, you'll want to read the docs for the New Relic tools that you're using, to see if they provide ways to report the custom data you need. We do have [APIs and SDKs](#build) for reporting custom data, but those require some study to use and should be your last resort. First you should see if you can configure a tool that you're already using.
4. **Make a plan.** It's possible to overwhelm yourself with too much data (and data ingest is a factor in [New Relic One pricing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing)), so you'll want to plan out what you're trying to accomplish and how the custom data will help you accomplish that. As part of that, you may also want to disable some default reporting: see [Manage data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-your-data/). 

Below are various ways to get custom data into New Relic, with some of the most common and popular methods near the top. 


## Add tags [#tags]

Tags are metadata you add to the entities you monitor, and other New Relic items, that help you organize your data and use it better. To learn more, see [Tags](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/use-tags-help-organize-find-your-data/). 

## Configure agents to send more data [#agents]

Our agents give you APIs for adding custom events and attributes in addition to what you're already reporting. For details, see [Send custom events and attributes](/docs/insights/event-data-sources/custom-events/report-custom-event-data/#ways).

Our APM, browser, and mobile agents also allow you to [report custom metrics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics/). 

## Convert existing data to metrics [#events-to-metrics]

One way to customize data is to [transform events and other data to metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/convert-data-metrics/analyze-monitor-data-trends-metrics/. Metric data is aggregated over time and so can be a better way to analyze and monitor trends over longer time periods.

This is one way to manage your data: [learn about other data management methods](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/manage-data/manage-your-data).

## Report logs [#logs]

Have logs you need to get into New Relic? See [Logging](/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/enable-log-management-new-relic/).

## Configure integrations [#integrations]

We have integrations for many platforms and services, like our [infrastructure integrations](/docs/integrations/infrastructure-integrations/get-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations/) and our [open source telemetry integrations](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relics-open-source-telemetry-integrations). Not all of those allow the reporting of custom data: you'll want to read the docs to see what each integration allows. 

## Report custom Synthetics data [#synthetics]

If you're using [synthetic monitors](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/getting-started/get-started-synthetic-monitoring/, you can create custom synthetic scripts, and [add custom attributes](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/add-custom-attributes-synthetic-monitoring-data/). 

## Use our APIs and SDKs [#build]

If you can't configure one of our existing tools to meet your needs, you can always use one our APIs or SDKs to report whatever data you want. 

* Our [Event API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-event-api) lets you report custom events and attributes. 
* Our [Telemetry SDKs](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/telemetry-sdks-report-custom-telemetry-data/) are an open source set of language-specific API client libraries that send data to the New Relic platform. Our [open-source integrations for telemetry tools](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/get-started/introduction-new-relics-open-source-telemetry-integrations/) (like Prometheus, Istio, and OpenCensus) were created using our Telemetry SDKs. You can use these SDKs to create your own telemetry data solutions.
* Our infrastructure monitoring [Flex tool](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/flex-integration-tool-build-your-own-integration) comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. It's an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services and is easy to use.  
* Build a custom [New Relic One application](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/new-relic-one-build-your-own-custom-new-relic-one-application) that lives in New Relic, can be shared with your team or the public, and that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. You can use New Relic One apps to analyze New Relic data, or bring in whatever data you want. 
* Finally, we have our [Trace API](/docs/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api/), [Log API](/docs/logs/log-management/log-api/introduction-log-api/), and [Metric API](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/ingest-manage-data/ingest-apis/introduction-metric-api/). Most customers don't use these directly and instead use the more curated tools, but they are available for more complex use cases.
