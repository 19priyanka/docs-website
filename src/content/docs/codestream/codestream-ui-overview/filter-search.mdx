metaDescription: "The CodeStream filter and search tool helps you find specific comments, issues, and feedback requests."

New Relic CodeStream's filter and search tools enable you to slice and dice your organization's collection of
comments, issues, and feedback requests however you see fit. By default, youâ€™ll
get a view of any open issues or feedback requests assigned to you, followed by
all open issues and feedback requests.
