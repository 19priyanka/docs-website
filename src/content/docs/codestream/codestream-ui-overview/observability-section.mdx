title: CodeStream observability
metaDescription: "The observability section is where you connect CodeStream to your New Relic account so that you can take advantage of these observability features."
---

In order to get the most out of CodeStream and New Relic, connect CodeStream to New Relic via your [New Relic user key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key).

Once that's done, for entities you're monitoring with New Relic, you'll see your errors directly in CodeStream. 

## Connect CodeStream and New Relic [#connect]

Go here to get or create your [New Relic user key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher).

Once you have your user key, in **Observability** click **Connect to New Relic One**, then paste your user key and click **Connect**.

## See your errors in CodeStream [#errors]
