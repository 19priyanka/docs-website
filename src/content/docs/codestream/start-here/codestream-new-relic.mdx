metaDescription: Read about the useful ways CodeStream and New Relic work together.
---

CodeStream and New Relic work together in several ways to give you insight into your code's errors, as well as making it easier to get started instrumenting your code with our APM agents.

## Connect CodeStream and New Relic [#connect]

Prerequisites:
* [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)
* [New Relic user API key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher)

In order to get the most out of CodeStream and New Relic, connect CodeStream to New Relic via your [New Relic user API key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key).

Once you have your API key, in **Observability** click **Connect to New Relic One**, then paste your API key and click **Connect**.

## Jump to the source of your errors [#errors]

Prerequisites:
* [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)
* [New Relic user API key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher)
* [CodeStream and New Relic connection](#connect)
* [A monitored application sending data to New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.explorer?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtY29yZS5saXN0aW5nIn0=&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYy5ucjEtaW5zdGFsbC1uZXdyZWxpYyIsImFjdGl2ZUNvbXBvbmVudCI6IlZUU09FbnZpcm9ubWVudCIsInBhdGgiOiJndWlkZWQifQ==)
* [A workload for errors inbox](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads/#create)
* [An error](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#error-details)

New Relic errors inbox is a single place to proactively detect, prioritize, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. Now via CodeStream, you can jump from an error directly to the code causing the error in your IDE.

From **[one.newrelic.com/](https://one.newrelic.com/) > Errors Inbox** click a strack trace error, then click **Open in IDE**.

## Install APM agents with CodeStream

Prerequisites:
* [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)
* [New Relic user API key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher)
* [CodeStream and New Relic connection](#connect)
* A supported language application codebase
    * .NET
    * Java
    * Node.JS

With CodeStream connected to New Relic, when you're working on an application's codebase that's not being monitored by New Relic, CodeStream will offer to instrument that application for you.

Like [New Relic's guided install](/docs/full-stack-observability/observe-everything/get-started/new-relic-guided-install-overview/), CodeStream will walk you through and automate all of the steps to installing the APM agent to start sending data to New Relic.

## Jump to the source of your Kubernetes usage spikes

Prerequisites:
* [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)
* [New Relic user API key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher)
* [CodeStream and New Relic connection](#connect)
* [A Kubernetes cluster monitored by Pixie](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/install-auto-telemetry-pixie/)

If you've instrumented your Kubernetes clusters with Pixie, then your CPU usage is represented by a [Pixie flamegraph](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie/#flamegraph). When there's a spike in CPU usage, **Open in IDE** will take you directly to the code responsible.
