New Relic lets you set up automated user provisioning (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from your identity provider, without having to use a New Relic UI or API. With this automated provisioning, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider.

## Requirements

Requirements and impacts:

* Requires Enterprise tier.
* Impact if you're on our [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing): This feature creates billable [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#user-type) and **those users can't be downgraded to basic users**.
* [User model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models)-related requirements:
  * This feature creates users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
  * To implement AUM, you must be on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) and have [user management roles assigned](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#add-user-managers). If you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative.
* Supports SCIM 2.0 standard.
* Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO).
* Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin.

## Import user groups from an identity provider using AUM [#how-to]

For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see [Group and role mapping](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/roles-permissions-automated-user-management).

To import user groups from your identity provider:

1. Use the [New Relic UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso) to enable SCIM and configure SAML SSO.
2. Configure your identity provider using information in one of our relevant guides: [Azure AD](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/azure-scimsso-application-configuration) \| [Okta](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/okta-scimsso-application-configuration) \| [OneLogin](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/onelogin-scimsso-application-configuration). If you don't use one of those providers, we also have a [SCIM API](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/scim-support-automated-user-management).
3. Recommended: Set a time zone in your identity provider. If not specified, our UI shows date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the "Olson" time zone database format (e.g., "America/Los_Angeles").

If you have issues, contact your account representative.

After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic.
