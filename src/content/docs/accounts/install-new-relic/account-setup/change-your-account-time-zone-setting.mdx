You can change the default time zone for your New Relic account. This timezone setting controls most time-related settings in the New Relic UI, though not all (see exceptions below).

<Callout variant="important">
  Changing your timezone may take up to 24 hours to be reflected in the UI.
</Callout>

To change your timezone: go to the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) and select **User preferences**.

## Exceptions

There are some New Relic features that don't rely on the user preference time zone settings. The following use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and aren't controlled by the time zone setting:

* [New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/introduction-alerts)
* Our [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/specifying-time-range-v2#utc)

Note that there may be other features where time zone doesn't rely on your default time zone.
