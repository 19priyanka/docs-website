New Relic [organizations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-account-structure) are on one of two pricing models, and we have separate sets of docs for each pricing model: 

* New Relic One pricing model ([see docs](/docs/new-relic-one-pricing-billing)): All New Relic organizations created on or after July 30, 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have [switched to this pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models/). 
* Our original product-based pricing model ([see docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing)): this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to [transition to the newer pricing model](#how-to-transition). 

### Determine your pricing model [#determine-pricing]

To determine which pricing model your organization is on: go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com), select the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), and select **Manage your plan**. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, youâ€™re on the new pricing model.

### Convert to new pricing [#switch-pricing]

Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. [Learn more about switching your pricing model.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models)

## How do the pricing model and the user model relate? [#pricing-user-table]

In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models). These models represent the future for all New Relic customers. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either [switch to the new pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models/) or [migrate their users to the new user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/). 

This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other:

    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}/>

      <th>
        Pricing plan factors

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Original pricing**
      </td>

      <td>
        If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our [original pricing model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing) until you [transition to New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models/).
      </td>

      <td>
        For original pricing accounts, you have users on the [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles) unless you've [migrated your users to the new model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/). 
        
        Note that if you've added users via [automated user management](/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign), they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models.

An organization is on the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing): 
* If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or
* If it's an older organization but has [switched to New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/switch-new-models/).

      <td>
If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/). 

If you have an older organization, you have users on the [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles) unless you've [migrated your users to the new model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/).
