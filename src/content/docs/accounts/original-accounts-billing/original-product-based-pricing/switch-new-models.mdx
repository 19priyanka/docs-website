New Relic has recently implemented a new pricing model and account/user structure (read an [overview of changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/)). Our new models have many benefits: simpler billing, ability to add free users, simplicity of managing users, and more. 

If you're on our [original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans) or if your users are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), this doc will explain how you can move to the new models. 


## How free accounts switch

Have a free account? You currently have access to all of New Relic One. However, if youâ€™d like to take advantage of the new pricing and account/user models, please [sign up for a new account](https://newrelic.com/signup/).

## How paying accounts migrate users to new model [#migrate-users]

If your users are on our [original user model](#user-models), you may have the ability to [migrate your users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/). Some organizations cannot yet do this. 

## How paying accounts switch to new pricing [#transition-paid]

If you're a paying account on our original pricing plan, you may only switch to the new pricing if one of these is true: 

* You're on month-to-month billing.
* You're within 60 days of your subscription renewal. 

If one of those is true, you may have access to a self-serve pricing migration in the UI. To use that UI: 

1. To find the UI option: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **Manage your plan** and then click **Plans and pricing** ([direct link](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjI0NDEyODYsIm5lcmRsZXRJZCI6ImNvbW1lcmNlLW5lcmRsZXRzLm5yLXNob3AtZW50cnkiLCJwYXRoIjoiL3BsYW5zLWFuZC1wcmljaW5nIiwibWlncmF0aW9uRWxpZ2libGUiOnRydWUsImFjY291bnROYW1lIjoiU3RyYWRvcyBMYWJzIn0=&platform[accountId]=)). If you don't see that UI, contact your account representative or ask questions in the [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/). 
2. Consider new billing factors. The [New Relic One pricing plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) bills on data ingest and the number of full users you have. You will likely want to downgrade some of your full users to basic users. Keep reading to learn more about these considerations and ensure you don't have billing surprises.  

### Downgrading full users to basic users

For [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/), your count of full users is one factor in billing. 

For organizations on our original pricing plan, by default all users are full users, because full user count is not a billing factor. This means that when you switch to the new pricing, you'll want to ensure that your users have the user type you want. To learn more about determining whether a user should be basic or full, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#user-type). 

Ideally you should update your users before switching to the new pricing. But the count of full users is pro-rated, so if you update user type soon after switching to new pricing, billing impact will be minimal. 

To update your users: 

1. Ensure you have admin permissions for managing users. 
2. If your organization has multiple accounts, you must update the user type for all users in all associated accounts. If you log into a sub-account, you won't be able to see or edit users outside of that sub-account. Here are some tips for making sure you're not missing accounts or users: 
  * If you're on our original account/user model: log into the master account and from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **Account settings** to see all sub-accounts.
  * If you're on our New Relic One user model, you can see and edit all users. To do this: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click **User management**. 
3. To see a count of your full users: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **View your usage** and view the **Users** chart. From there, you can click **Manage users** to edit your users. 

### Understand data ingest 

Your data ingest is one factor in [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/). To better understand your data ingest, here are some tips:

* From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown), click **Manage your data**, then click **Data ingestion**. This page gives you an overview of your current data ingestion over the last 30 days. 
* If you want to see a view over a long time, go to the time picker on the right side of the page, where it says **Since 30 days ago** and select a different time range.
* To see more detail on ingest, scroll down to see an ingest breakdown.
