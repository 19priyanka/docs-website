This doc is about organizations on our original account/user model, not the [New Relic One model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure/).

Since July 30, 2020, new signups to New Relic are on our New Relic One account/user model. Older customers who have not yet [migrated to the new model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/) are still on our original account/user model. The original account/user model will be increasingly deprecated as more New Relic customers are migrated to the new model.

Note that the account/user model is not directly related to our two different [pricing plans](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans).

Here are some important aspects of the original account/user model and links to important docs: 

* Our original user model did not have firm boundaries between organizations/customers, and was much more user-centric. This meant that a user could be granted access to data from different organizations, and could access that data from a single login. [Read more about the differences between the old and new model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). 
* On the original user model, a user’s access to accounts is based on: a) being added to a specific account, or b) having access to a master account and inheriting access to that account’s sub-accounts. See our [original user management docs](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). See an [explanation of how master/sub-accounts work](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure).
