## Overview and benefits [#overview]

On December 15, 2021, we released a version of our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new type of user: the [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). This pricing version is sometimes referred to as "New Relic One with core users."

The **core user** user type was created for a new set of New Relic users: developers focused on writing and shipping code, as opposed to traditional New Relic users who primarily manage uptime and reliability for production apps and systems. 

Core users are more affordable than full platform users, while having greater access than free basic users. They are a good choice for when your New Relic users need more power than basic users have, but don't need all the powers (and cost) of a full platform user.  

As a core user, you get access to the core New Relic platform capabilities that [basic users have](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), plus a curated set of developer-friendly capabilities that help you understand issues related to your code, make data-informed development decisions, and collaborate with engineers throughout your organization. Core users can: 

* Use [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/new-relic-codestream-quick-start) to correlate performance issues with code in your IDE. 
* Use our [errors inbox feature](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to proactively view and manage errors from across your stack.
* Use our [log management UI](/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management) to get deep visibility into application and infrastructure events. 
* Build and run [custom New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/build-custom-new-relic-one-application) and use [open source apps from our catalog](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks). 
* Get more access to our GraphQL-format [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). 

For more details about specific capabilities, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 

## Availability [#availability]

The core users release is currently available for only some New Relic organizations. If it's available for your organization, your organization will receive messaging about that, either via [opt-in messaging](#nr1core-optin) in your billing management UI, or from your New Relic account representative.

If your organization has the ability to add core users, you're on this version. If you don't, you're on our [primary New Relic One pricing version, without core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

## Details on opting in to core users [#nr1core-optin]

Some organizations will have a self-serve option in the UI for opting in to this release. The UI acceptance form is referred to as the "core amendment." By accepting this amendment, the New Relic user is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. 

If you accept the core amendment, your organization has a seven-day grace period, during which your users’ user type won't affect billing. This gives you time to [decide which user type to assign your users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#choose-user-type). After the grace period ends, the [new billing calculation rules](#user-calculation) apply. 

## Billable user calculations [#user-calculation]

Note that this doc applies only for organizations that have opted in to the [core users release](#nr1core-optin).

The best way to understand your user count is to go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).

To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the users during that month who had a **billable user type** of either full platform user or core user. A user’s **billable user type** is defined as the highest user type that the user was set at during a calendar month, no matter how briefly. 

For an example of how this works in practice: If a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a month, their billable user type for that month is "full platform user," and won't change, even if they downgrade later that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly.

If you're planning on adding billable users or changing your users' user type, you should keep these rules in mind. Some tips: 

* If you want to add a billable user or upgrade a user, you might want to do that at the beginning of the month. 
* If you want to downgrade a user, you might consider doing that at the end of the month. 

The count of your unique users is determined by email address. If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes those user records would count as a single user, and that user's billable user type would be their highest user type assigned during that month.

The cost of your billable users depends on an organization’s [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) or on any custom deals you have with New Relic. 

When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, their billable user count is pro-rated based on when during the month they started. If an organization cancels their subscription, prorating is also applied for their last month. 

## Downgrade rules [#downgrade-rules]

Note that this doc applies only for organizations that have opted in to the [core users release](#nr1core-optin).

How frequently you can downgrade a full platform user depends on your [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans): 

* Pay-as-you-go: There are no rules limiting changing user type but remember that [upgrading a user has billing impacts](#nr1core-user-calculation). 
* Annual pool of funds: 
  * When upgrading a user, remember that [upgrading has billing impacts](#nr1core-user-calculation). 
  * Because the [annual pool of funds usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans) involves a longer-term commitment, we limit how frequently full platform users can be downgraded. A user can only go from having a full platform user billable user type to a lower billable user type twice during one contract year (defined as a year starting at an organization’s contract starting point, or at the anniversary of that contract start). Once that limit is exceeded, that user is considered a full platform user for the remaining months in that year. 
    * Let’s look at an example of how this works for an organization whose year-long contract started March 1st. A full platform user switches to a basic user for the month of May, then goes back to being a full platform user for the month of June, and then becomes a basic user for the month of August. That user has reached the two-times-per-year limit. If that user then becomes a billable full platform user again for a subsequent calendar month in that remaining year, that user counts as full platform user for the remaining months in that contract year, regardless of what their user type is changed to.
  * If your organization has opted in to add core users, the two-times-per-year limit on downgrading full platform users will apply from when you opted in until the renewal of your subscription term or, if applicable, the annual anniversary date of your commitment term, whichever is earlier. 

## Change to "full user" language [#full-user-language]

On December 15, 2021, the “full user” user type was renamed to “full platform user," for all New Relic organizations. For more detail, see [Full user language](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#full-user-language).
