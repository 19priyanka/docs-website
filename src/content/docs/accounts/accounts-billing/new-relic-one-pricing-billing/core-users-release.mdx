On January 12, 2022, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type: [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 

## Overview of core users release [#overview]

On January 12, 2022, we released a version of our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a third user type: the [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and that changed [billing calculation rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

With this release, New Relic has two versions of the New Relic One pricing model: 

* Our primary New Relic One pricing version: this is the version with core users. It's available to 1) new sign-ups on or after January 12, 2022, and 2) some organizations who meet [requirements for switching to this version](#availability). 
* The "New Relic One without core users" version: organizations on this version can add only basic users and full platform users (not core users). This version will be increasingly deprecated over time. See the [relevant rules for this version](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#non-core).

## Benefits [#benefits]

Organizations with the core user version have access to three [user types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#user-type-defined): 

* Basic users
* Core users (new)
* Full platform users

Core users are more affordable than full platform users, while having greater access than free basic users. This user type is a good choice for developers who write and ship code but who aren't responsible for managing uptime and reliability for production apps and systems. The core user is also a good general choice if your users need more power than basic users have, but don't require all the powers (and cost) of a full platform user.  

As a core user, you get access to the New Relic capabilities that [basic users have](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), plus a curated set of developer-friendly capabilities that help you understand issues related to your code, make data-informed development decisions, and collaborate with engineers throughout your organization. Core users can: 

* Use [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/new-relic-codestream-quick-start) to correlate performance issues with code in your IDE. 
* Use our [errors inbox feature](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox) to proactively view and manage errors from across your stack.
* Use our [log management UI](/docs/logs/get-started/get-started-log-management) to get deep visibility into application and infrastructure events. 
* Build and run [custom New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/build-custom-new-relic-one-application) and use [open source apps from our catalog](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks). 
* Get more access to our GraphQL-format [NerdGraph API](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). 

Note that this release also changes [how billable users are calculated](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-calculation) and [rules on downgrading users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#downgrade-rules).

For more details on user capabilities, and tips on deciding a user's user type, see [User types](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type). 

## Availability [#availability]

The core users release is currently available to: 
* New sign-ups to New Relic on or after January 12, 2022. 
* Some existing organizations that meet certain requirements. If it's available to your organization, you will receive messaging about that, either via [opt-in messaging](#nr1core-optin) in your billing management UI, or from your New Relic account representative.

If your organization has the ability to add core users, you're on this version. If you don't, you're on the ["New Relic One without core users" version](#overview).

## Details on opting in via the UI [#nr1core-optin]

Some New Relic organizations that existed before January 12, 2022, have an option for opting in to the newer core user release via the UI. The UI acceptance form is referred to as the "core amendment." The New Relic user that accepts this amendment is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization.

When you accept the core amendment, your organization has a seven-day grace period, during which your users’ user type won't affect billing. This gives you time to [decide which user type to assign your users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type/#choose-user-type). After the grace period ends, the new [billing calculation rules](#user-calculation) apply. 

When you accept the core amendment, you'll probably want to review your users and adjust their user types. How you do this will depend on which user model your users are on: 

* [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#edit-user-type) 
* [Original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#update-user-type): note that if you have multiple accounts, you need to go into all accounts to see and manage each account's users. 

## Changes to how users are counted [#user-calculation]

The core user release has changed how billable users are calculated. For details, see [Billable user calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-count). 

## Changes to user downgrade rules [#downgrade-rules]

The core user release has changed the rules pertaining to downgrading users. For details, see [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules). 


## Change to "full user" language [#full-user-language]

In November of 2021, the “full user” user type was renamed to “full platform user," for all New Relic organizations. For more detail, see [Full user language](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#full-user-language).
