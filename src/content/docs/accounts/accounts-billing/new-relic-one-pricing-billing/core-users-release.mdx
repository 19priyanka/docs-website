On December 15, 2021, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type ([core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) and changed [how billable users are counted](#user-calculation). 

This pricing version is referred to as "New Relic One with core users." If your organization has the ability to add core users, you're on this version. If you don't, you're on our [primary version, without core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). 

This release is currently available to only some New Relic customers. If you have not received messaging that the core users release is available to your organization, it isn't yet available for you. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. 

## Opting in to core users [#nr1core-optin]

For organizations for which the core users release is available, they will have a self-serve option in the UI for opting in to this release. The UI acceptance form is referred to as the "core amendment." By accepting this amendment, the New Relic user is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. 

When your organization opts in, your organization has a seven-day grace period, during which your users’ user type won't affect your bill. This gives you time to [decide which user type to assign your users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#choose-user-type). 

After your grace period ends, the [new billing calculations](#user-calculation) apply. 

## Billable user calculations [#user-calculation]

Note that this doc applies only for organizations that have opted in to the [core users release](#nr1core-optin).

The best way to understand your user count is to go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).

To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the users during that month who had a **billable user type** of either full platform user or core user. A user’s **billable user type** is defined as the highest user type that the user was set at during a calendar month, no matter how briefly. 

For an example of how this works in practice: If a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a month, their billable user type for that month is "full platform user," and won't change, even if they downgrade later that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly.

Our billing logic has several implications for when you should adjust user type:
* If you want to upgrade a user, you should do that at the beginning of the month.  
* Similarly, if you want to downgrade a user, you should do that at the end of the month. 

The count of your unique users is determined by email address. If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes those user records would count as a single user, and that user's billable user type would be their highest user type assigned during that month.

The cost of your billable users depends on an organization’s [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) or on any custom deals you have with New Relic. 

When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, their billable user count is pro-rated based on when during the month they started. If an organization cancels their subscription, prorating is also applied for their last month. 

## Downgrade rules [#downgrade-rules]

Note that this doc applies only for organizations that have opted in to the [core users release](#nr1core-optin).

How frequently you can downgrade a full platform user depends on your [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans): 

* Pay-as-you-go: There are no rules limiting changing user type but remember that [upgrading a user has billing impacts](#nr1core-user-calculation). 
* Annual pool of funds: 
  * When upgrading a user, remember that [upgrading has billing impacts](#nr1core-user-calculation). 
  * Because the annual pool of funds [usage plan](?) involves a longer-term commitment, we limit how frequently full platform users can be downgraded. A user can only go from having a full platform user billable user type to a lower billable user type twice during one contract year (defined as a year starting at an organization’s contract starting point, or at the anniversary of that contract start). Once that limit is exceeded, that user is considered a full platform user for the remaining months in that year. 
    * Let’s look at an example of how this works for an organization whose year-long contract started March 1st. A full platform user switches to a basic user for the month of May, then goes back to being a full platform user for the month of June, and then becomes a basic user for the month of August. That user has reached the two-times-per-year limit. If that user then becomes a billable full platform user again for a subsequent calendar month in that remaining year, that user counts as full platform user for the remaining months in that contract year, regardless of what their user type is changed to.
  * If your organization has opted in to add core users, the two-times-per-year limit on downgrading full platform users will apply from when you opted in until the renewal of your subscription term or, if applicable, the annual anniversary date of your commitment term, whichever is earlier. 

## Change to "full user" language [#full-user-language]

On December 15, 2021, the “full user” user type was renamed to “full platform user," for all New Relic organizations. For more detail, see [Full user language](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#full-user-language).
