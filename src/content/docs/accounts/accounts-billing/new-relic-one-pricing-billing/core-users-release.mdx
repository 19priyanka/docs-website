On December 15, 2021, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type ([core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) and changed [how billable users are counted](#nr1-pricing-with-core). This pricing verion is referred to as "New Relic One with core users." If your organization has the ability to add core users, you're on this version. 

This release is currently available to only some of our customers. If you have not received messaging from us that the core users release is available to your organization, it isn't yet available for you. 

## Opting in to core users [#nr1core-optin]

For organizations for which the core users release is available, they will have a self-serve option in the UI for opting in to this release. The UI acceptance form is referred to as the "core amendment." By accepting this amendment, the New Relic user is stating that they're authorized to accept the terms of that amendment for their organization. 

The core user amendment is available to organizations that [maybe we don't need to say this]:
* ... ? 
* ... ? 

When your organization opts in, your organization has a seven-day grace period, during which your users’ user type won’t affect your bill. This gives you time to [decide which user type to assign your users](?). After your grace period ends, the normal billing calculations apply. 
 
If your organization has opted in to add core users, the [two-times-per-year limit on downgrading full platform users](#nr1core-downgrade-rules) will apply from when you opted in until the renewal of your subscription term or, if applicable, the annual anniversary date of your commitment term, whichever is earlier. 

## Change to "full user" language [#full-user-language]

On December 15, 2021, the “full user” user type was renamed to “full platform user," for all New Relic organizations. For more detail, see [Full user language](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type#full-user-language).
