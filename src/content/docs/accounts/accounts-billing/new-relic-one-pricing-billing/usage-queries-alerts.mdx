For accounts on our [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing), we provide a [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) for understanding your billing-related usage and a [UI for managing billing-related data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data). Additionally, you can:

* [Query your usage data](#query) to get more detail than is available in the UI.
* [Set up NRQL alert conditions](#alerts) to get notifications about changes in your usage.

Note that if you're on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), your account hierarchy may affect your queried data. For more information, see [Account structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/account-user-structure).

## Data ingest usage queries [#data-queries] 

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) displays your data ingest over time. If you need more detail than the UI provides, here are some example [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) queries:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="daily-gb"
    title="Daily data usage"
  >
    This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' 
       SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="daily-source"
    title="Daily usage by source"
  >
    This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago 
       FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

    <Collapser
    id="metrics-analysis"
    title="Metrics ingest by source"
  >
This query breaks down [Metric data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by `appName` or `host` to adjust the analysis.

    ```
    FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' 
      SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' 
      FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="month-gb"
    title="Month-to-date data usage"
  >
    This query shows the current full platform user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now.

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="month-cost"
    title="Month-to-date estimated data cost"
  >
    This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Billable user queries [#user-queries]

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) displays your billable user count over time. If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can use the example NRQL queries below. For details about the calculation logic, see [Billable user calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#user-count). 

If you have opted in to our [limited availability release of core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release), your [billing calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) are different, and your NRQL queries are impacted: 

* New Relic One pricing **without core users** (with only basic users and full platform users): This is the main version of New Relic One pricing. To query full platform users, use the `FullUsersBillable` attribute. 
* New Relic One pricing **with core users**: To query full platform users, use the `FullPlatformUsersBillable' attribute. 

Here are example queries for each of these versions: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="primary-user-queries"
    title="Primary pricing version (without core users)"
  >

**Billable full platform users for the month:**

This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now.

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable) 
      SINCE this month
    ```

    This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time.

    ```
    from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) 
      SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour
    ```

**Projected monthly full platform user count:**

This query shows a projected count of monthly full platform users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) 
    SINCE '2020-09-01'
    ```
  </Collapser>

**Count of full platform users and basic users:**

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing#billing-usage-ui) shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is:

```
FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') 
FACET metric
```

To see the count of full platform users and basic users over time:

```
FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago
WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' 
WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour
```
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="core-version-user-queries"
    title="Limited core users release"
  >

If you've [opted in to have core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release), here are some example NRQL queries for determining user count: 

**Month-to-date full platform users:** 

This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your full platform users for that month if you were billed right now.
```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullPlatformUsersBillable)
SINCE this month
```

**Month-to-date core users:**

This query shows the number of core users youâ€™d be billed for if you were billed right now:
```
FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(CoreUsersBillable)
SINCE this month
```

</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Set usage alerts [#alerts]

To help [manage your billable data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-your-data), you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with [NRQL queries here](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#create).

<Callout variant="caution">
  When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data.
</Callout>

Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see [Attributes](#attributes).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-value"
    title="Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
    ```

    If you have multiple [child accounts](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/manage-apps-or-users-sub-accounts), you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount:

    ```
    FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = <var>YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID</var>
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="gb-exceeds-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="user-threshold"
    title="Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(FullUsersBillable)
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="usage-exceeds-cost"
    title="Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost"
  >
    This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost:

    ```
    FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) 
       WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Available data types [#data-types]

Usage data is attached to these [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#events-new-relic):

* `NrConsumption` records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of "real-time" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. 
* `NrMTDConsumption` generates aggregate values from the `NrConsumption` event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period.
* `NrUsage` records usage every hour and is used to see the types of data being reported (for example, APM data or browser monitoring data).

To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).
