This is an explanation of the New Relic One pricing model, which is a usage-based model that bills on data ingest and your number of billable users. Not sure which pricing model you're on? See [Overview of pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model).

## How New Relic One pricing works [#how-pricing-works]

Our New Relic One pricing model bills on these factors:

* Your [ingested data](#usage-calculation). 100 GBs per month is free. US$0.25 per GB ingested above that. 
* Your billable users ([full platform users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) and [core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)). Basic users are free. Your billable user cost depends on your [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise). Standard edition includes one full platform user. 

For an overview of New Relic One pricing and more details about what the different editions get you, see our [main pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing). For in-depth details about billing calculations and rules, keep reading. 

## View usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).
 
 <Callout variant="important">
If you’re on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): The UI view of billable users may differ from how many users you see in the **Users and roles** UI. For more information, see [User count discrepancy](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#full-user-count).
</Callout>

## Data ingest calculation [#usage-calculation]

One billing factor is the amount of ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data saved for your New Relic organization (your set of accounts sharing the same billing) after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the amount of raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up being stored. 
 
To view and manage your usage, go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing).
 
Other calculation details:
* In the context of New Relic One pricing, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes.
* Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs.

## Core users release [#core-users-release]

On December 15, 2021, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type ([core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) and changed [how billable users are counted](#nr1-pricing-with-core). This release is currently available to only some of our customers. For more information, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release). 

## User count calculation [#user-count]

The main way to understand your billable user count is to go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing). If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can also run usage-related queries. 

How your billable users are calculated depends on which of [two versions of New Relic One pricing](#core-users-release) you’re on:

  >
If your organization is on the New Relic One pricing model but does **not** have the ability to add core users, you're on a version of pricing referred to as "New Relic One without core users." For more information, see [Core users release](#core-users-release).

The following billing calculations and rules apply to your organization:

* **How billable users are determined.** For a calendar month, an organization is billed based on a calculation of the number of full platform users for that month. 
* **Prorating in first and last month.** The count of billable users is prorated based on when a New Relic organization starts their subscription, or based on when a user becomes a full platform user (added as a full platform user or converted to one).
* **Users are billable when provisioned.** A user counts as billable the moment they are set to a billable user type in New Relic. This applies regardless of whether that user has ever logged into or used New Relic. 
* **User count based on email address.** If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes that would count as a single user.
* **Caveat for our original user model.** If your organization has users on our [original user model](?): If a user is set as a basic user in one account in the organization and as a billable user in another account, the billable user status takes precedence.

</Callout>

The [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing) displays a count of billable users and is the best place to go to understand your user count. 

To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the users during that month who had a **billable user type** of either full platform user or core user. A user’s **billable user type** is defined as the highest user type that the user was set at during a calendar month, no matter how briefly. 

For an example of how this works in practice: If a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a month, their billable user type for that month is "full platform user," and won't change, even if they downgrade later that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly.

Our billing logic has several implications for when you should adjust user type:
* If you want to upgrade a user, you should do that at the beginning of the month.  
* Similarly, if you want to downgrade a user, you should do that at the end of the month. 

The count of your unique users is determined by email address. If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes those user records would count as a single user, and that user's billable user type would be their highest user type assigned during that month.

The cost of your billable users depends on an organization’s [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) or on any custom deals you have with New Relic. 

When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, their billable user count is pro-rated based on when during the month they started. If an organization cancels their subscription, prorating is also applied for their last month.

## User downgrade rules [#user-downgrade-rules]

The rules governing downgrading users depends on which of the [two versions of New Relic One pricing](#core-users-release) you’re on: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="nr1-without-core-downgrade"
    title="New Relic One without core users - downgrade rules"
  >
 <Callout variant="important">
If your organization is on the New Relic One pricing model but does **not** have the ability to add core users, you're on a version of pricing referred to as "New Relic One without core users." For more information, see [Core users release](#core-users-release).
</Callout>

User type is meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on a user’s expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. For that reason, a full platform user may only be downgraded a maximum of two times in a 12-month period. If a user’s user type has changed more than this allowed number of changes, New Relic can charge that user as a full platform user. 

[this seems illogical to me for PAYG, because we can't force them to keep paying us when they're PAYG, right?]

On December 17, 2021, we released a version of New Relic One pricing that added a new user type ([core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) and changed how billable users are counted. [Learn more about this core users release.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)

How frequently you can downgrade a full platform user depends on your [usage plan](#?): 

* Pay-as-you-go: There are no rules limiting changing user type but remember that [upgrading a user has billing impacts](#nr1core-user-calculation). 
* Annual pool of funds: 
  * When upgrading a user, remember that [upgrading has billing impacts](#nr1core-user-calculation). 
  * Because the annual pool of funds [usage plan](?) involves a longer-term commitment, we limit how frequently full platform users can be downgraded. A user can only go from having a full platform user billable user type to a lower billable user type twice during one contract year (defined as a year starting at an organization’s contract starting point, or at the anniversary of that contract start). Once that limit is exceeded, that user is considered a full platform user for the remaining months in that year. 
    * Let’s look at an example of how this works for an organization whose year-long contract started March 1st. A full platform user switches to a basic user for the month of May, then goes back to being a full platform user for the month of June, and then becomes a basic user for the month of August. That user has reached the two-times-per-year limit. If that user then becomes a billable full platform user again for a subsequent calendar month in that remaining year, that user counts as full platform user for the remaining months in that contract year, regardless of what their user type is changed to.

## Usage plan: pay-as-you-go vs. annual pool of funds options [#usage-plans]

When you’re on New Relic One pricing, you can have one of two types of usage plans:
* **Pay-as-you-go**: This usage plan bills at the end of each calendar month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. When you input your credit card and start your subscription, your first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from the time you input your credit card.
* **Annual pool of funds**: This usage plan is for longer-term contracts (for example, a year-long contract, or longer). New Relic makes an estimate of your future usage and applies an upfront payment (a “pool of funds”) towards that usage. 

For more about how your usage plan can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](#user-downgrade-rules). 

## Restrictions on sharing logins [#login-sharing]
[need better place for this]
A New Relic user is prohibited from sharing their login with other people. To allow you to use New Relic on several devices, a user’s login credentials can be associated with a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions or three unique IP addresses at one time. 

## What can I get for free? [#free]

If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](#how-pricing-works) and on the [Standard pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what you’re able to get for free:

* Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month.
* One [full user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), and unlimited [basic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).
* A single account (you can have more than one account with [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing)).
