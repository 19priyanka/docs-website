This is an explanation of the New Relic One pricing model, which is a usage-based model that bills on data ingest and your number of billable users.

New Relic has two pricing models. Not sure which model you're on? See [Overview of pricing](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models).

## How New Relic One pricing works [#how-pricing-works]

Our New Relic One pricing model is meant to be simple and to provide a lot of value even when you're [using New Relic for free](#free). Our pricing model bills on these factors:

* Your [ingested data](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing). We bill on data ingested, no matter the type, making your billing easy to understand. 100 GBs per month is free. The price per GB above that can vary depending on which [data plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) you're on.
* Your [billable user count](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing). Core users and full platform users are billable. Basic users are free. Your per-user cost depends on your [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise). Standard edition includes one free full platform user.

For an overview of New Relic One pricing and more details about what the different editions get you, see our [main pricing page](https://newrelic.com/pricing).

## Pricing plan options [#plan-variations]

The New Relic One pricing model has several variations that can affect your billing:

* **Core users**: On January 12, 2022, we released a new version of New Relic One pricing with a new user type (the core user) and a different way of calculating billable users. For details, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).
* **Data Plus**: On June 1, 2022, we released a more powerful data option called Data Plus. For details, see [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices).

## View usage in the UI [#billing-usage-ui]

For how to find billing and usage information in the UI, see [Billing-related UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings).

## Data ingest calculation [#usage-calculation]

Want to understand how data ingest is calculated? See [Data ingest calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing).

Want to manage your data? See [Manage data](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic).

## User count calculation [#user-count]

To learn how billable users are calculated, see [User count calculation](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

## Announcement: removal of estimated cost in May of 2022 [#estimated-cost-removal]

In May of 2022, we removed the current month's estimated cost from the usage UI and from usage-related events. We're doing this to avoid confusion in cases where the estimated cost differs from the actual cost. Details on this change:
* **Removal of estimated cost from the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui).** The usage UI will show your usage and show invoices, as always, but there won't be an estimated cost for the current month. 
* **Removal of `estimatedCost` attribute.** This attribute is being removed from the events `NrMTDConsumption` and `NrConsumption`. 

For tips on how to run queries to return an estimated cost, or on how to replace existing queries that use `estimatedCost`, see [Estimated cost queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts#estimated-cost).

Note that viewing and editing billing settings requires the [**Billing user** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#standard-roles). 

## Billing scheduling options [#usage-plans]

A New Relic organization can have one of several types of plans that govern how billing scheduling is handled. Here are the main options:

* **Pay-as-you-go**: This usage plan bills at the end of each calendar month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. When you input your credit card and start your subscription, your first end-of-month bill includes billable usage starting from the time you input your credit card.
* **Contracts**: Contract options include **Annual pool of funds** and **Savings** plans. These types of plans are longer-term contracts (for example, a year-long contract, or longer) and available primarily to Pro and Enterprise edition organizations. With these types of plans, we work with you to create an estimate of your expected usage. For the annual pool of funds plan, an upfront payment (a "pool of funds") is applied towards future usage.

For more about how these options can affect your user downgrade rules, see [Downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

If your organization is on [New Relic One pricing](#how-pricing-works) and on the [Standard pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing), you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what you're able to get for free:
