metaDescription: For New Relic One pricing, an explanation of how billable users are calculated and rules for downgrading users.
---

For [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the count of billable users is one billing factor.

## Pricing versions (core and non-core) [#pricing-versions]

On January 12, 2022, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that unlocked a new user type ([core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) and changed how billable users are calculated. This means that we have two versions of New Relic One pricing: 

* Our primary New Relic One pricing version: this is the version with core users. See its [billing calculation rules](#user-count).
* The "New Relic One without core users" version: organizations on this version can add only basic users and full platform users (not core users). This version will be increasingly deprecated over time. See the [billing calculations and downgrade rules for this version](#non-core).

For more about the differences between these versions, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).

## Billable user calculation [#user-count]

The main way to understand your billable user count is to go to the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/introduction-account-settings/#pricing). If you need more detail than the UI provides, you can also run [usage-related queries](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts).

To determine an organization's count of billable users in a calendar month, we count the users during that month who had a **billable user type** of either full platform user or core user. A user’s **billable user type** is defined as the highest user type at which a user was set during a calendar month. 

For an example of how this works in practice: If a user is set as a full platform user at any point during a month, their billable user type for that month is "full platform user," and won't change, even if they downgrade later that month. This is the case even if that user is changed to a full platform user only briefly.

If you're planning on adding billable users or changing your users' user type, you should keep these rules in mind. Some tips: 

* If you want to add a billable user or upgrade a user, you might choose to do that at the beginning of the month. 
* If you want to downgrade a user, you might choose to do that at the end of the month. 

The count of your unique users is determined by email address. If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes those user records would count as a single user, and that user's billable user type would be their highest user type assigned during that month.

The cost of your billable users depends on an organization’s [pricing edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) or on any custom deals you have with New Relic. 

When a New Relic organization first starts being billed, their billable user count is pro-rated based on when during the month they started. If an organization cancels their subscription, prorating is also applied for their last month. 

## User downgrade rules [#user-downgrade-rules]

<Callout variant="important">
This section applies only for organizations on the [our primary New Relic One pricing version](#pricing-versions) (the version with core users).
</Callout>

* For pay-as-you-go [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans): There are no rules limiting downgrading of users but our [billing calculation rules](#user-calculation) may impact your upgrade/downgrade decisions. 
* For annual-pool-of-funds [usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans): 
  * When upgrading a user, ensure you understand the [billing calculation rules](#user-calculation).
  * Because the [annual pool of funds usage plan](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#usage-plans) involves a longer-term commitment, we limit how frequently full platform users can be downgraded. A user can only go from having a full platform user billable user type to a lower billable user type twice during one contract year (defined as a year starting at an organization’s contract starting point, or at the anniversary of that contract start). Once that limit is exceeded, that user is considered a full platform user for the remaining months in that year. 
    * Let’s look at an example of how this works for an organization whose year-long contract started March 1st. A full platform user switches to a basic user for the month of May, then goes back to being a full platform user for the month of June, and then becomes a basic user for the month of August. That user has reached the two-times-per-year limit. If that user then becomes a billable full platform user again for a subsequent calendar month in that remaining year, that user counts as full platform user for the remaining months in that contract year, regardless of what their user type is changed to.
  * If your organization has opted in to add core users, the two-times-per-year limit on downgrading full platform users will apply from when you opted in until the renewal of your subscription term or, if applicable, the annual anniversary date of your commitment term, whichever is earlier. 


## New Relic One pricing without core users [#non-core]

The following rules apply only for organizations on the [version of New Relic One pricing **without core users**](#pricing-versions):

The following rules apply only for organizations on the [version of New Relic One pricing without core users](#pricing-versions): 

* **How billable users are determined.** For a calendar month, an organization is billed based on a calculation of the number of full platform users for that month. 
* **Prorating in first and last month.** The count of billable users is prorated based on when a New Relic organization starts their subscription, or based on when a user becomes a full platform user (added as a full platform user or converted to one).
* **Users are billable when provisioned.** A user counts as billable the moment they are set to a billable user type in New Relic. This applies regardless of whether that user has ever logged into or used New Relic. 
* **User count based on email address.** If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes that would count as a single user.
* **Caveat for our original user model.** If your organization has users on our [original user model](?): If a user is set as a basic user in one account in the organization and as a billable user in another account, the billable user status takes precedence.

The following user downgrade rules apply for organizations on the [version of New Relic One pricing without core users](#pricing-versions): 

User type is meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on a user’s expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. For that reason, a full platform user may only be downgraded a maximum of two times in a 12-month period. If a user’s user type has changed more than this allowed number of changes, New Relic can charge that user as a full platform user.
