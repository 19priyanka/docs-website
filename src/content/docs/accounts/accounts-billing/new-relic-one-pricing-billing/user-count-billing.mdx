metaDescription: For New Relic One pricing, an explanation of how billable users are calculated and rules for downgrading users.

For [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), the count of billable users is one billing factor.

## Pricing version differences [#core-and-noncore-versions]

On December 15, 2021, we released a version of [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) that added a new user type ([core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) and changed how billable users are counted. This release is currently available to only some New Relic customers. These two versions of pricing are sometimes referred to as: 

* New Relic One **without** core users (primary version)
* New Relic One **with** core users (limited availability version)

For more information, see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release).

## Billable user calculation [#user-calculation]

<Callout variant="important">
If your organization has opted in to the core users release, you have different rules: see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release). 
</Callout>

Here are calculation rules for our [primary New Relic One pricing version](#core-and-noncore-versions):  

* **How billable users are determined.** For a calendar month, an organization is billed based on a calculation of the number of full platform users for that month. 
* **Prorating in first and last month.** The count of billable users is prorated based on when a New Relic organization starts their subscription, or based on when a user becomes a full platform user (added as a full platform user or converted to one).
* **Users are billable when provisioned.** A user counts as billable the moment they are set to a billable user type in New Relic. This applies regardless of whether that user has ever logged into or used New Relic. 
* **User count based on email address.** If there are multiple user records in an organization that have the same email address, for billing purposes that would count as a single user.
* **Caveat for our original user model.** If your organization has users on our [original user model](?): If a user is set as a basic user in one account in the organization and as a billable user in another account, the billable user status takes precedence.


## User downgrade rules [#user-downgrade-rules]

<Callout variant="important">
If your organization has opted in to the core users release, you have different rules: see [Core users release](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release). 
</Callout>

Here are calculation rules for our [primary New Relic One pricing version](#core-and-noncore-versions):  

User type is meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on a user’s expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. For that reason, a full platform user may only be downgraded a maximum of two times in a 12-month period. If a user’s user type has changed more than this allowed number of changes, New Relic can charge that user as a full platform user. 

[this seems illogical to me for PAYG, because we can't force them to keep paying us when they're PAYG, right?]
