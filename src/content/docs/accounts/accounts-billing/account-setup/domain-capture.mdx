When you have a [New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), sometimes your users won't know they should be using that organization and will accidentally sign up for New Relic and create a new, separate New Relic organization. This can result in confusion and wasted time. 

With **domain capture**, you can register your domain with New Relic. When you do that, users with emails from your domain will automatically be routed into your New Relic organization, where you want them to go. The larger your organization is, the more useful domain capture will be. 

## Requirements [#requirements]

Setting up domain capture requires:

* Pro or Enterprise edition
* The **Organization settings** [admin setting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts/#admin-settings)

## How to set up domain capture [#setup]

To set up domain capture: 

* From the [**Administration** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks/#where), click **Domain management**. 
* Click **Add domain** and complete the [DNS verification steps](#dns) and configure [the user settings](#user-settings). 

When you're done with those steps, domain capture is live for your users. Users who try to sign up for New Relic and who have an email address from your domain are asked to verify their email. When that's done, they'll be presented the option of joining your existing New Relic organization.

For more detail on the domain capture setup steps, keep reading. 

## DNS verification [#dns]

As part of the domain capture setup, you'll complete a DNS verification process. This involves providing a DNS record from your domain registrar and a TXT record from your IT department. If necessary, you'll also configure a host.

## User settings [#user-settings]

As part of the domain capture setup, you'll set how incoming users are handled. This includes: 

* The [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) they'll be added to 
* The [group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-concepts#groups) they'll be added to
* Their [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)
* An optional message for them
