To view and edit account-related settings, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and in the top right corner, select the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown). 

Keep reading for tips on how to find different kinds of account settings in the UI. 

## Pricing, billing, and usage UI [#pricing]

Note that [user permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/) may impact your access to some account settings. 

How you access usage and billing-related UI can differ depending on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) you're on and which [pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans) you're on. To find this UI, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#account-dropdown) in the upper right corner, then look for these UI pages, if available: 

* **Administration**: Click this to see options related to billing, usage, and user management. 
* **Manage your plan**: View and manage billing details. 
* **Account settings**: This UI is visible to users on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans). It gives you access to: 
  * List of subscriptions (on that page) 
  * **Subscription**: see more details about your subscription. 
  * **Usage**: see usage for your subscription. 

For more details on how pricing plans work: [Original pricing plan](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/product-pricing/product-based-pricing) | [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing).

## Manage users [#manage-users]

How you manage users depends on which [user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) your users are on:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser className="freq-link" id="new-relic-one-user-model" title="New Relic One user model">

For managing users on the New Relic One user model, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where).

</Collapser>

<Collapser className="freq-link" id="original-user-model" title="Original user model">

To manage users on the original user model: from the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) in the upper right, click **Account settings** and then click **Users and roles**. 

For more on managing these users, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/).
