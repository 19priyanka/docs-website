For users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles), we provide various user management features, including the ability to:

* Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to users
* Create custom user groups
* Use groups to control what sets of users have access to

<Callout variant="important">
  This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model). Not sure which user model you're on? See [Overview of user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model).
</Callout>

## Requirements

<Callout variant="tip">
  As a quick way to check if you can access user management features, you can go to the [user management UI](#where) and see what you have access to.
</Callout>

Requirements:

* These features allow managing of users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models). To learn more, see [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#how-pricing-users-relate).
* Pricing tier requirements:
  * To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: [Pro or Enterprise tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) is required.
  * To [import users from an identity provider](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/configure-authentication-domains-sso#source-users): [Enterprise tier](https://newrelic.com/pricing) is required
* Some capabilities require the [**Organization manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) and some require the [**Authentication domain manager** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles).

## Manage users in the UI [#where]

For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), to find your user management options: From the [account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Administration**. There are two user management options there: 

* **User management.** Use this to add and update users, including changing a [user's type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#user-type) (basic vs full) and group: 
* **Organization and access.** Use this to manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to configure SAML SSO and SCIM. 

<Callout variant="important">
  If you can't use or access these UI pages, it may be because your users are on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model) or because you don't have a [required user management role](#requirements).
</Callout>

## Overview of user management concepts [#understand-concepts]

To optimally use our user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the "group access grant," which grants a group of users access to a) a specific role in b) a specific account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up a group access grant.

Note that if you're simply adding a user to a [default group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#groups) (**Admin** or **User**) in the account you're in, you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply [add a user](#add-users) to that group and that group already has an associated access grant. But if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant.

Note that this applies to users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (and not our original user model).
</figcaption>

For a tutorial on how to grant groups access, see this [User management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model#group-access).

Here are more explanations of our user management terms and how they relate to each other:

* A **capability** is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities:
  * The ability to modify APM settings
  * The ability to delete alert conditions
* A **role** is a set of capabilities. Our default [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities.
* A user **group** has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have [default user groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#group-roles) (**Admin** and **User**), and you can make your own groups.
* An **access grant** is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, "This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account." Adding a user to a group doesnâ€™t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant.
* An [**authentication domain**](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains) contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML.
* If a user is a [basic user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see [Basic user and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type-roles).

## Tips for managing your users [#manage-users]

Here are some important user management tips:

* Basic users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models) are able to self-serve to immediately upgrade to be [full users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type), which are billable users. This is possible so that if you have an incident, your team members are immediately able to work on a problem.
* A basic user always has the capabilities of a basic user, no more and no less. This is true even if a basic user is assigned to a group that has very limited capabilities. [Learn more about basic users and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type-roles).
* To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the [`NrAuditEvent`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/nrauditevent-event-data-query-examples).
* A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time.

## Example user management tasks [#workflow]

Here are some example user management procedures:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-users"
    title="Add and edit users"
  >
    To add or edit users, use the [User management UI](#where).

    To add users there:

    1. If you have multiple [authentication domains](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains), choose one from the authentication domain dropdown.
    2. Click **Add user**.
    3. Complete the process, including choosing [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) and [user group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-group).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="new-group"
    title="Create new groups and roles"
  >
    See our [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="add-user-managers"
    title="Grant user management capabilities"
  >
    To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has one or more of the organization-scoped user management [roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) (for example, **Organization manager** and **Authentication domain manager**) assigned.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Users cannot have only [organization-scoped roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default **Admin** group).
    </Callout>

    You have two options:

    * From the [User management UI](#where), you can add a user to the default [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#groups), which includes both of those roles.

      OR
    * Assign these specific roles to a group. For a tutorial on that, see [Tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model#group-access).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
