In this doc you'll learn how we define **user type**, what capabilities each user type has, and how to decide on a user type. 

Want to learn about how users are calculated for billing purposes? See [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing). 

## What is "user type"? [#user-type-defined]

A user’s **user type** is what determines the set of New Relic capabilities a user can theoretically access. In practice, users will sometimes have [roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/groups-roles-capabilities) assigned to them that limit their capabilities in various ways, but the user type represents their maximum theoretical set of capabilities. 

There are three user types:

* **Basic user**: several basic but powerful New Relic capabilities.
* **Core user** ([limited availability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release)): has more capabilities than a basic user. 
* **Full platform user**: all capabilities. 
 
On the [New Relic One pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), basic users are free, and core users and full platform users are billable. Your user count is tracked in the [usage UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui). Because user count is a billing factor, it's important to understand [how user billing calculation works](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).
 
If you're tasked with [adding New Relic users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#add-users), one of the key decisions to make is what user type to make them. If you're not sure at first, you can add them as basic users and later decide which users you want to upgrade. For how to adjust user type, see [Manage user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#edit-user-type).
 
The user type is meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on a user's expected New Relic responsibilities over the next several months or longer. That intention is reflected in our [billing calculations](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing) and [downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules). For more frequent or more granular adjustments to a user's New Relic access, you can [assign them to more restrictive roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/groups-roles-capabilities). 

## Overview of user type capabilities [#user-type-capabilities]

Here's an overview of each user type’s capabilities: 

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th className="fcenter">
            Basic user
          </th>

          <th className="fcenter">
            Core user ([limited availability](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release))
          </th>

          <th className="fcenter">
            Full platform user
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
Basic users are free and you can have an unlimited number of them. They can set up New Relic observability tools, run queries of your data, create charts and dashboards, use some basic alerting features, and more. 

For more detail, see the [capabilities table](#user-type-comparison-table). 
          </td>

          <td>
Core users can access more features than basic users but less than full platform users. They have access to some powerful developer-centric features like New Relic CodeStream, our logs UI, and the ability to build New Relic One apps. 

For more detail, see the [capabilities table](#user-type-comparison-table).
</td>
          <td>
Full platform users can access everything, including our more curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, and more.

For more detail, see the [capabilities table](#user-type-comparison-table).
</td>
        </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Remember that the user type governs a user's theoretical access. In practice, users can have [roles assigned](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/groups-roles-capabilities) that restrict their access further.

## Choosing the right user type [#choose-user-type]

For New Relic One pricing, user type is a factor in billing. Before deciding on user types, you'll want to ensure you understand [user count calculations and user downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing).

Here are some tips for deciding on a user type: 

**Reasons to make someone a full platform user:**

* They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle.
* They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team.
* They have DevOps practices (for example, version control systems, and implementation of CI/CD).
* They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform.
* They need to be able to manage users and/or billing.

**Reasons to make someone a [core user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release):** 

* They're developers who aren't tasked with reliability and uptime as their primary responsibility.
* They don’t require full platform access, but would benefit from some of the specific functionalities offered to core users, like: 
  * Debugging code issues directly from their IDE, using [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/start-here/what-is-codestream).
  * Viewing errors in one place from across your stack, using [Errors Inbox](/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox). 
  * Using our [logs management UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui) to spot problems and patterns in logs. 
  * The ability to [build and deploy New Relic One apps](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/build-new-relic-one/build-custom-new-relic-one-application), and use apps from [the app catalog](https://opensource.newrelic.com/nerdpacks).


**Reasons to make someone a basic user:**

* They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle.
* They use and configure New Relic tools to get data into New Relic, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team).
* They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives).
* They don't need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform.
* They don't manage users or billing.

## Manage user type [#manage-user-type]

For how to manage user type, see [Manage user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-management-ui-and-tasks#edit-user-type).

For rules governing user upgrades/downgrades, see [User downgrade rules](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/user-count-billing#user-downgrade-rules).

## Change to "full user" name [#full-user-language]

On December 15, 2021, the "full user" user type name was changed to "full platform user." 

For organizations that are on New Relic One pricing and that [do not have core users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/core-users-release): 
* "Full platform users" are equivalent to "full users" and "monthly provisioned users" in your New Relic agreement. 
* When [querying your full platform user counts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/usage-queries-alerts), the `FullUsers` attribute is used.   

## Lacking access to something? [#access]

For questions related to lack of access to New Relic accounts or features, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#account-access). 

## Relation of user type to roles and groups [#user-type-groups-roles]

Want to learn how user type relates to the group and role concepts? See [Groups, roles, and capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/groups-roles-capabilities#role-user-type).
