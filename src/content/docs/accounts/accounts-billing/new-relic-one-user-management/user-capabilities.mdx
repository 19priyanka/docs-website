A role, whether one of our pre-built roles or a custom role, is a set of capabilities. You can think of a "capability" as "something a New Relic user can do." Examples of capabilities are: the capability to view APM app settings, or modify alert conditions. 

To learn what capabilities a role has, go to the user management UI and view a specific role.

## Important things to know about capabilities [#important-points]

Some important points for understanding and using capabilities: 
* **Capabilities can change.** The capabilities we expose in the UI are subject to change and reorganization. The capabilities in this doc were last updated May, 2022.     
* **Some capabilities have overlapping functionality.** That is why selecting some capability checkboxes will automatically check or uncheck other boxes.
* **Some capabilities are not exposed.** Some roles have hidden capabilities that are not visible in the UI and not available for addition to a custom role. For example, the Organization manager role has capabilities related to managing and configuring organization-level settings, but those are not available for addition to a custom role. 
* **Capabilities don't affect querying.** Most capabilities apply to New Relic UI experiences and not to querying data. For example, if your capabilities restrict you from accessing the APM UI, you can still query APM-related data using the query builder if you have access to that account. If you require more firm data boundaries for some projects or users, one way to do this is by [adding accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/add-accounts).

## Capability definitions [#capability-definitions]

Here's a composite screenshot of the capabilities we expose in the capabilities UI for the purpose of adding to custom roles.

## How capabilities relate to roles [#capabilities-roles]

Groupings of capabilities are aggregated into roles. Roles work differently depending on which of our [user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/overview-user-models) a user is on: 

* New Relic One user model: learn about roles. 
* Original user model: [learn about roles](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model).
