  This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). [Learn about user models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).

We provide several ways for you to manage your New Relic users. Here are our main docs related to managing users:

* [User model/structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles): an explanation of basic aspects of our account/user structure, such as user type (basic user vs full user), default groups (**Admin** and **User**), and our standard roles.
* [Managing users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants): the basics of New Relic user management concepts.
  * A [tutorial on how to add new groups and roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model)
* [User authentication](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): configure how users are added to New Relic (manually versus automatically with an identity provider), and the authentication method (via manual login versus SAML SSO).
* Having problems with logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems).
* To understand user-related billing factors, see [User-related billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#user-count).
