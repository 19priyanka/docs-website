<Callout title="New pricing model">
This doc is for users on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models).
</Callout>

Some important things to note before starting: 

* The docs in this section are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. [Learn about user models.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) Note that this is a separate topic from our [two different pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model). 
* For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). 

## User management docs [#docs]

Here are our main docs for managing users: 

* [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): learn about basic users, core users, and full platform users. 
* [Groups, roles, and capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/groups-roles-capabilities): learn what groups, roles, and capabilities are, and how they relate.
* [How to manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants): an overview of user management concepts, where to manage users in the UI, and some common user management tasks.
* [Authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): configure an authentication domain, which governs how your users are added to New Relic (manually versus SCIM provisioning), the authentication method they use (manual login versus SAML SSO), managing how users upgrade their user type, and user session settings.
* [Introduction to SAML and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim): an overview of SAML SSO and SCIM options. 
* [User management tutorials](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model): learn how to add users, how to grant users access to new roles and accounts, and more.
