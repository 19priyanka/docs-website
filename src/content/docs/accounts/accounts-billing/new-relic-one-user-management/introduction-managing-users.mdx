Some important things to note before starting: 

* The docs in this section are for managing users on the New Relic One account/user model. [Learn about user models.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) Note that this is a separate topic from our [two different pricing plans](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model). 
* For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). 


## User management docs [#docs]

Here are our main docs for managing these users: 

* [User model/structure](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles): learn some basic aspects of our user model, such as user type (basic user vs full user), default groups (**Admin** and **User**), and roles and capabilities.
* [Managing users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants): an overview of user management concepts, some common user management tasks, and where to manage users in the UI.
* A [tutorial on how to create new groups, roles, and access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model)
* [Authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): configure an authentication domain, which governs how your users are added to New Relic (manually versus SCIM provisioning), the authentication method they use (manual login versus SAML SSO), managing how basic users become full users, and user session settings.
* For an overview of SAML SSO and SCIM options, see [Introduction to SAML and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim).
* Having problems logging in? See [Login troubleshooting](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems).
* To understand user-related billing factors, see [User-related billing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/new-relic-one-pricing-billing#user-count).
