Some important things to note before starting: 

* The docs in this section are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. [Learn about user models.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-user-models) Note that this is a separate topic from our [pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models). 
* For managing users on our original user model, see [Original users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles). 

## User management docs [#docs]

Here are our docs about managing users: 

* [User permission concepts](?): learn about how users get access to specific capabilities and to specific accounts. 
* [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): learn about basic users, core users, and full platform users. 
* [Common user management tasks](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/manage-user-groups-roles-access-grants): learn how to add users, adjust user type, add users to groups, create custom roles, and more. 
* [User management tutorials](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model): more in-depth tutorials for common user management tasks.  
* [User management UI videos](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-mgmt-videos): watch videos of the user management UI in action. 
* [Introduction to SAML and SCIM](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/introduction-saml-scim): an overview of SAML SSO and SCIM options. 
* [Authentication domain settings](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/configure-authentication-domains): an "authentication domain" is what governs how users in that domain are added to New Relic (manually versus SCIM provisioning), the authentication method used by those users (manual login versus SAML SSO), managing how users upgrade their user type, and user session settings.
