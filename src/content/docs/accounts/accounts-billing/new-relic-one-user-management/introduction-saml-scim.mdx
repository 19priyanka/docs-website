metaDescription: Introduction to New Relic's SAML SSO and SCIM user management options.

When it comes to the more automatic methods for controlling how your New Relic users are added, managed, and how they log in, we have these main features: 

* SAML SSO: this allows your users to use a single sign-on (SSO) identity provider service to log in to New Relic, as opposed to using the default email + password. SAML equires [Pro or Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 
* SCIM provisioning, also referred to as automated user management (AUM): SCIM provisioning allows organizations to use their identity provider service to automate how their users are added to and updated in New Relic. By definition, SCIM provisioning requires use of SAML SSO. This requires [Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing). 

Before enabling these, it’s important to understand that which procedure you’ll use is affected by which New Relic account/user model your organization is on. In 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model, called the New Relic One user model. At first only new customers had access to it, but now it’s available to some of our older customers via a [self-serve user migration procedure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration/). Over time all organizations will be migrated to this model. 

For tips on how to enable SAML and SCIM, choose your account/user model below. If you’re not sure which you’re on, see [Overview of account/user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).

If your organization is on the New Relic One account/user model, you'll use the [authentication domain UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more) to set up SAML and SCIM.

If your organization is on the original account/user model, we recommend migrating your users via the self-serve migration procedure if you’re able to. If you don’t meet the requirements but want to enable SAML and/or SCIM, please speak to your New Relic account representative to see if they can help you switch. 

Here are some tips and docs links: 

* SAML: If you want to or must stay on the original user model and can’t migrate to the new model, see our original SAML docs.
* SCIM + SAML: SCIM provisioning creates users on the new model. This is why your organization must first switch to the new user model before using SCIM. For more on how to migrate to the new model, see Migrate users.
