<Callout variant="important">
  This doc applies to users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). For more on this, see [User model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).
</Callout>

This doc will explain the concepts of groups, roles, and capabilities. 

## How do user type and groups relate? [#user-type-groups-relation]

When it comes to your New Relic users' level of New Relic access, there are two major factors at work: 

* The [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type): For organizations on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing), your users' user type is a billing factor. The user type is what sets the maximum allowed capabilities a user can access. It is meant to be a fairly long-term setting based on someone's expected New Relic duties.  
* Role assignments: once a user's user type is set, **roles** are used to more precisely control a user's access, if desired. Roles are sets of **capabilities**, which are the granular New Relic abilities (for example, the ability to modify New Relic APM settings). Roles are assigned to [user groups](#groups). 

Another way to think about the above: a user's user type overrides any role restrictions. For example: a basic user might be assigned a role with wide New Relic access, but their ([basic user](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type)) restrictions override those role permissions.

## What are groups? [#groups]

For users on our New Relic One user model, a "group" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. A New Relic user always requires assignment to at least one group to have access to a New Relic account. Here's an explanation of how groups are tied to specific capabilities: 

* A user gets assigned to one or more **group**. 
* With an [access grant](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts), a group is granted access to a specific **role** on a specific account. A role is a set of capabilities.  
* A capability is a specific New Relic ability. Examples of capabilities:
  * The ability to modify APM settings
  * The ability to delete alert conditions

Note that groups are **not** what restrict a user's capabilities: it's the **role** that is assigned to that group that contains the actual capabilities. 

We have two default groups (see below). And Pro and Enterprise organizations can [create custom groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#group-access).

Users and groups are located within an [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/), which is what controls settings related to how users are added and managed (for example, via SCIM provisioning) and how users log in to New Relic. 

## Default groups [#default-groups]

We have two default groups:

* **User**: This group allows a user to use and configure our observability and monitoring features but **not** perform account-level tasks like managing billing or managing other users. It has access to the [**All product admin**](#standard-roles) role, which gives access to our observability platform tools, but doesn't have the **Organization manager** and **Authentication manager** roles, which give access to the account-level capabilities. 
* **Admin**: has all capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the [standard roles](#standard-roles) of **All product admin**, the **Billing user**, the **Organization manager** and the **Authentication domain manager**. 

To change a user's group, use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

## Standard (default) roles [#standard-roles]

Roles are sets of [capabilities](#capabilities). We have several "standard roles," which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the [**Organization and access** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where). 

<Callout variant="important">
Note that some of our [standard roles](#standard-roles) have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are **Standard user** and **Read only**; all others have some hidden capabilities.

Our standard roles include:

        Account
      </td>

      <td>
        Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (**Authentication domain manager** role), managing organization/account-structure settings (**Organization manager** role), and managing billing (**Billing user** role).

        Note: the **Standard user** role is essentially the **All product admin** role minus observability feature configuration capabilities.

        Note: the **Standard user** role is essentially the **All product admin** role without that role's ability to configure platform features.

      <td>
        Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization.

Due to our recent switch to the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time.

### How do roles relate to user type? [#role-user-type]

User type doesn't directly relate to roles. Some specifics: 

* A basic user's capabilities aren't defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having our [**All product admin** role](#standard-roles) but without access to most of our more curated UI experiences. 
* A core user is similar to a basic user; it just has a few more capabilities.

## Capabilities [#capabilities]

A role, whether one of our [standard roles](#standard-roles) or a custom role, is a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the [**Organization and access** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where).

<Callout variant="important">
Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see [Standard roles](#standard-roles).

## 2020 user model changes [#limitations]

If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see [User model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#impacts-user-model).
