<Callout variant="important">
  This doc applies to users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). For more on this, see [User model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models).
</Callout>

When adding users to New Relic, the key decisions you must make are: 

* What user type they should be. The user type is what governs the maximum allowed New Relic capabilities that user can access.  
* What group to place a user in. A group is what gives you the ability to limit a user's capabilities further than the user type, if you wish. Also, groups are used to grant users access to other New Relic accounts. 

This doc will explain the concepts of groups, roles, and capabilities. For information on user type, see [User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type).  

## Groups [#groups]

For users on our New Relic One user model, a "group" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts.

We have two default groups: 

* **User**: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but **not** perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the **All product admin** role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the **Organization manager** and **Authentication manager** roles. 
* **Admin**: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the **All product admin**, the **Billing user**, the **Organization manager** and the **Authentication domain manager** [roles](#standard-roles). 

Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can also [create custom groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#group-access) with whatever roles they want to assign. 

Note that groups are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group. If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see [Access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

To change the group a user is in, use the [**User management** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles#where).

Groups are located within a New Relic [authentication domain](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/authentication-domains-saml-sso-scim-more/), which includes settings related to how users are added and managed (for example, via SCIM provisioning) and how users log in to New Relic.

## Defining groups, roles, and capabilities [#definitions]

* A **capability** is an ability to use a specific New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities:
  * The ability to modify APM settings
  * The ability to delete alert conditions
* A **role** is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions (in addition to any [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) restrictions). 
* A user **group** has one or more roles associated with it. A user must be assigned to a group in order to have access to New Relic. We have [default user groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#group-roles) (**Admin** and **User**), and Pro and Enterprise edition organizations can make custom groups.


## Roles and capabilities [#roles]

For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models), a "role" can be defined as "a set of capabilities." A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' ([learn more about capabilities](#capabilities)). 

Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups [**Admin** and **User**](#groups) already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise [edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) can also create [custom roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).

### Standard (default) roles [#standard-roles]

Roles are sets of [capabilities](#capabilities). We have several "standard roles," which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the [**Organization and access** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where). 

<Callout variant="important">
Note that some of our [standard roles](#standard-roles) have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are **Standard user** and **Read only**; all others have some hidden capabilities. 
</Callout>

Our standard roles include:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "180px" }}>

      <th style={{ width: "120px" }}>

      <td>
        Account
      </td>

      <td>
        Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (**Authentication domain manager** role), managing organization/account-structure settings (**Organization manager** role), and managing billing (**Billing user** role).

        Note: the **Standard user** role is essentially the **All product admin** role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Standard user**
      </td>

      <td>
        Account
      </td>

      <td>
        Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure [synthetic monitor secure credentials](/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/using-monitors/store-secure-credentials-scripted-browsers-api-tests)) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. 

        Note: the **Standard user** role is essentially the **All product admin** role without that role's ability to configure platform features.

      <td>
        Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization.

Due to our recent switch to the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models), this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time.

For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the [user management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model). 

### Capabilities [#capabilities]

A role, whether one of our [standard roles](#standard-roles) or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the [**Organization and access** UI](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#where).

<Callout variant="important">
Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see [Standard roles](#standard-roles).

## Manage users

To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/add-manage-users-groups-roles).

## How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? [#type-role-group]

For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/transition-guide-new-pricing-user-changes#user-models), here's a table explaining how [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type), roles, and groups relate to each other: 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "100px" }}>

      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Full user
      </th>

      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        Basic user
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        **Group**
      </td>

      <td>
        Full users can be assigned to [default groups](#groups) (**User** and **Admin**) or custom groups. 
      </td>

      <td>
        When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with.
        For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        **Role**
      </td>

      <td>
For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see [Default groups](#groups). 

Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles.
      </td>

      <td>
A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the [**All product admin** role](#standard-roles) but without access to our more curated UI experiences ([learn more about user type](#user-type)).

When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with.  
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## 2020 user model changes [#limitations]

If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see [User model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#impacts-user-model).
