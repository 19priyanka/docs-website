Depending on your account/user model, you have different options for adding and managing accounts and assigning users to them. We have two models: 

* [New Relic One account/user model](#new-model)
* [Original account/user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/original-account-structure)

<Callout variant="important">
Note that the account/user model is not directly related to our [two pricing plans](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#pricing-plans).

## New Relic One account/user model [#new-model]

<Callout variant="important">
This section is about organizations on the New Relic One account/user model, not the original model. [Learn more about the difference.](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models)

At New Relic, an "organization" is the representation of a New Relic customer. The organization contains everything pertinent to a New Relic customer: its accounts, its users, and its data. For organizations on [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/), usage that impacts billing is aggregated at the organization level. 

A New Relic "account" can be considered a workspace. For example, you might have an account for a specific app, or a set of related hosts and services for a specific initiative or project, or you might have an account for a specific team.

Our [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for a single account per organization. [Pro and Enterprise editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allow for multiple accounts per organizations. Currently you can't add accounts to your organization on your own. To add accounts, talk to your New Relic account representative. 

### How users access accounts [#account-access]

One effect of the organization structure is that you require a separate login for each New Relic organization on the new model. For example, if you're a contractor requiring access to several New Relic organizations that are on the new model, you'll need to sign out of one organization and into the other. If you have multiple logins associated with a single email address, you can [verify your account to see all associated logins](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/troubleshoot-new-relics-password-email-address-login-problems/#verify-email).

Users inside an organization are granted access to specific accounts, as befitting those users’ belonging to specific teams or projects. To manage users’ access to accounts, you create [access grants](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts), which assign a group of users to a specific role on a specific account. For example, you may assign some users the ability to manage other users or manage billing on some accounts, and assign other users as non-admin full users on some accounts, and assign other users as basic users on some accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that’s a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. [Learn more about user management.](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/)

Note that some features, like dashboards and workloads, can display data from across different accounts in an organization. This means that if a user isn’t granted access to all relevant accounts, they may experience missing data. To learn more about access issues, see [Factors affecting access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/). 

## Original account/user model [#original-model]
