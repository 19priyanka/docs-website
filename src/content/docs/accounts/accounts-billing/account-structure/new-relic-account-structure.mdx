Depending on your account/user model, you have different options for adding and managing accounts and assigning users to them. 

## Impacts of account/user model [#user-model]

How you manage accounts and users differs based on which of our account/user models your organization is on. To learn more about the account/user models and determine which you're on, see [User models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). The major differences are: 

* Original account/user model: Our original model uses a parent/child account structure, where child accounts inherit settings from parent accounts. If you're on this model, see the [Original user model docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/mastersub-account-structure). 
* New Relic One account/user model: This is our new, improved model. We currently are migrating some customer accounts to this model and eventually all our customers will be on this model. To learn more and see if you can migrate your users, see [Migrate users](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/user-migration). To learn more about how account and user management works, keep reading. 

## Account structure for New Relic One account/user model [#account-structure]

For organizations on the New Relic One account/user model, here are some details about how organization and account management work: 

* The [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for a single account per organization. [Pro and Enterprise editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for [multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/mastersub-account-structure/#users).
* At the top level of a New Relic account hierarchy is the concept of the "organization." Your group of related accounts that share the same billing are inside a single "New Relic organization." 
* Currently you can't add accounts to your organization on your own. To add accounts, talk to your New Relic account representative. 
* To learn how you assign users permissions and access to specific accounts, see [Manage users](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/add-manage-users-groups-roles/#understand-concepts).
