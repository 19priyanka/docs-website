Some tips for understanding New Relic account/user structure:

* At the top level of New Relic's account hierarchy is the concept of the "organization." A New Relic customer's group of related accounts are considered to be inside a single "New Relic organization."
* For accounts with [New Relic One pricing](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/pricing-billing):
  * The [Standard edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for a single account per organization. [Pro and Enterprise editions](https://newrelic.com/pricing) allows for [multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/mastersub-account-structure/#users) and more complex account configuration. 
* New Relic offers you a view of data from across accounts in the same organization. For more details, see [Account access](/docs/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access).
* It's possible for a single email address to be associated with multiple organizations and logins. For more on this, see [Account access](/docs/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access).
* Billing-related usage is calculated at the level of the organization. This can mean that usage data may not display organization-level usage if being viewed at a sub-account level.
