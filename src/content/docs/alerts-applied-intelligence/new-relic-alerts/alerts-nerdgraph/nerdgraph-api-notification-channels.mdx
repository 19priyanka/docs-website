You can manage your notification channels using our GraphQL NerdGraph API. Here are some queries and mutations you can develop in our [NerdGraph API explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql).

## List and filter policies [#list-and-filter]

The `policiesSearch` query allows you to paginate through all of your policies per account. It also allows some filtering functionality on the account policies.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="list-all-policies"
    title="Listing all policies for an account"
  >
    Here's an example:

    ```
    {
      actor {
        account(id: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>) {
          alerts {
            policiesSearch {
              policies {
                id
                name
                incidentPreference
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Create a policy [#create-policy]

In order to create a policy, supply a name and an `incidentPreference`.

The incident preference will configure how incidents get created for each condition created in the policy. For more information, refer to the documentation about [choosing your incident preference](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/specify-when-new-relic-creates-incidents).

```
mutation {
  alertsPolicyCreate(accountId: <var>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</var>, policy: {
    name: "Your Policy Name"
    incidentPreference: PER_CONDITION
  }) {
    id
    name
    incidentPreference
  }
}
```
