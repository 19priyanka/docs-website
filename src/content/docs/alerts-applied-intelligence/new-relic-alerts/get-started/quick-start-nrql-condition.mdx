metaDescription: How to start writing NRQL alerts conditions with a step-by-step user case.
---

Use [NRQL queries](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/) to create alerts conditions with ease. That way, you can define what you need to be notified about.

Your condition only needs two attributes: a query and a threshold. Your query determines what you want to be notified about, and the threshold determines when you’ll be notified. In our example, you want to be notified about a host’s CPU usage (query) when usage is above 90% (threshold).

Follow these steps to write your first alerts condition using the NRQL query builder. Once you're done, you'll have a working alerts condition.

If you haven't already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) before you start. It's free, forever. Then, send your data into New Relic to query.

## Step 1: Write your query

Determine what alerts condition you want to query before continuing. You can create an alerts condition from any NRQL query. Find the NRQL query builder either at the top or bottom of the New Relic One platform.

  The graph icon at the top includes the "Create alerts" button that will be used in this example. Click the "Open in Query builder" button after using the bottom NRQL query choice to reach the same page.

In our example, our condition shows us each host’s CPU utilization. Write out the NRQL query as seen in the image below to track each host individually.

  This query finds the average CPU utilization from a system and then breaks it down (facets) by individual host names.

Our NRQL query language is a powerful tool that lets you write queries on any entity and its attributes. For more on NRQL, see [NRQL syntax](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/#syntax).

Once you create a valid NRQL query, click on the “Create alert” button.

## Step 2: See your query results

Visualize your NRQL alerts condition on New Relic One to make it easier for you to see how your systems are performing. In our example, our query shows how each host’s average CPU utilization is performing. A violation will open if any host’s average CPU utilization is over 90% and can alert us.

  The above screenshot shows the critical and warning threshold lines. These will appear once you define your thresholds.

If you would like to define signals, gap filling, or more, see [Create NRQL alerts conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/). 

## Step 3: Create an alerts condition with thresholds

Finish setting up your first alerts condition. Set thresholds to determine when you’re alerted. In this example, our condition checks for any hosts with CPU utilization over 90% for at least 3 minutes.

  This is the "Set your condition thresholds" section on the form for creating an alert. Complete the other sections as needed.

At least one critical threshold is required for your alerts condition. You can add a warning thresholds as desired. It's important to note that warning thresholds will **not** notify you like the critical threshold will.
