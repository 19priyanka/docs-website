Use the New Relic Navigator's mini-overview to get alert condition recommendations for your monitored entities. With these recommendations, you can create alerts conditions to be notified when your entities aren't performing as they should.

Condition recommendations are only available for APM-monitored entities.

## Why it matters

The condition recommendation is all about making it easier for you to find entities and conditions you want to be notified about.

## How it works

From the entity detail pane, you can quickly create an alert condition. When you click **Add recommended conditions**, the UI provides a list of recommended conditions you might want to be notified about.

Select one or more conditions and then assign them to an existing policy or create a new one.

Once you've added a condition, you can change its settings like any other NRQL condition.
