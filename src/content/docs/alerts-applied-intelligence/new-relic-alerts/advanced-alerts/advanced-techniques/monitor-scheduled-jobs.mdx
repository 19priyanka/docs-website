metaDescription: How to use loss of signal settings to monitor jobs and be alerted when they don't happen.
---

You can use critical warning thresholds and loss of signal settings to monitor scheduled jobs and be notified when they don't happen.

## What you need to know

In order to get the most out of this procedure, you'll need to know how to [create a condition](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions).

This only works for **Static** or **Baseline** threshold types.

## How it works

Typically, conditions use critical thresholds to trigger violations. However, a loss of signal can also be used for this. To monitor a scheduled job and be notified when it doesn't happen, set your condition's threshold high enough so that it won't trigger a violation. That way, only a loss of signal will trigger a violation.

## Monitor a scheduled job

1. Create a condition related to the job you want to monitor.
2. In **Set your condition thresholds**, set the **Critical** threshold above or below where it would ever trigger.
3. Click **+ Add lost signal threshold**, then set the signal expiration duration time longer than your monitored job's scheduled cycle.
4. Check **Open new "lost signal" violation**.
5. Make sure you name your condition before you save it.
