We have two options for using APIs for programmatically managing New Relic's alerting and applied intelligence features: 

* NerdGraph: this is the API we recommend. NerdGraph is our primary API and more functionality will be added to it over time. [See the NerdGraph alerting docs.](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/alerts-nerdgraph/nerdgraph-api-examples)
* REST API: this was our original API. We're no longer working on this API and that's why we recommend using NerdGraph. If you're currently using the REST API, we recommend switching to NerdGraph. [See the REST API for alerting docs.](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/rest-api-alerts/rest-api-calls-alerts)
