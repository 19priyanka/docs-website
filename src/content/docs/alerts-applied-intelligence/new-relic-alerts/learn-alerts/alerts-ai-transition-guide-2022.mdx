metaDescription: 'Resources to make a successful transition as new functionalities in New Relic One replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life in 2022.'
---

Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition.

## What's changing [#changes]

Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence.

If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to:

    title="February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types."
  >

  **Reason for EOL:** [Outlier conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/advanced-alerts/advanced-techniques/outlier-detection-nrql-alert/) don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities.

  **Replacement:** Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition.

    title="May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds."
  >

  **Reason for EOL:** The [NRQL sum of query results](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#sum) option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal.

  **Replacement:** Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now.

    id="incident-response"
    title="2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow."
  >

  **Reason for EOL:** The classic [incident response workflow](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/specify-when-alerts-create-incidents/) involves the **Incident** and **Violation details** pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations.

  **Replacement:** We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One.

    id="notifications"
    title="2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies."
  >

  **Reason for EOL:** The [current alerting setup process](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/learn-alerts/alerts-concepts-workflow) is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation.

  **Replacement:** Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace [current notification channel options](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/). This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels.

  * Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow.

    id="condition-types"
    title="2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types."
  >

  **Reason for EOL:** Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our [many types of alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-alert-conditions/) have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities.

  **Replacement:** This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/) instead of other types.
