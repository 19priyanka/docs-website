## Analyze [#analyze]

![A screenshot of the analyze section.](./images/alerts-ai-analyze.png "The analyze section.")

<figcaption>Use the analyze section to get a high-level view of your violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies.</figcaption>

The [overview page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page) shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations.

The **Issues & activity** page shows your most recent [issues](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#issues), [incidents](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#incidents), and [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#anomalies).

## Detect [#detect]

![A screenshot of the detect section.](./images/alerts-ai-detect.png "The detect section.")

<figcaption>Use the detect section to review and create your alerts policy conditions and anomaly detection configurations.</figcaption>

The [alert conditions (policies) page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here.

The [anomaly detection page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/expanded-anomaly-detection/) lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. You can add or edit the configurations here.

## Correlate [#correlate]

<figcaption>Use the correlate section to manage your incident intelligence sources and decisions.</figcaption>

The [sources page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#1-configure-sources) shows your configured incident intelligence sources. You can add new sources or configure existing ones.

The [decisions page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/) shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions.

## Enrich & notify [#enrich]

![A screenshot of the enrich & notify section.](./images/alerts-ai-enrich.png "The enrich & notify section.")

Use the [muting rules page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/) to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications.

Use [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to add more data to your alerts notifications.

Use [destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#2-configure-destinations) to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent.

Use [pathways](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#3-configure-pathways) to configure where your correlated issues get sent.

Use [incident workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies.

Use [incident destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/) to add and configure third-party services for your incidents.

## Settings [#settings]

![A screenshot of the settings section.](./images/alerts-ai-settings.png "The analyze section.")

<figcaption>Use the settings section to review and manage your incident intelligence usage.</figcaption>

Use the [events and incidents pages](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents/) to review alerts violations and other events.

Use the [channels page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/) for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels.
