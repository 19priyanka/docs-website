New Relic allows you to customize the event sent by mapping custom values to your destination platforms. This configuration is called a **Message template**, and is written in **Handlebars** syntax.
## Variables [#variables]

Variables are New relic product-specific attributes used as part of the event-template configuration. They are content enclosed by double curly braces **{{}}**, and are used as **[Handlebars expressions](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html)**.

## The Variables Menu [#variables-menu]

Variables can be picked from the Variables menu and are grouped into subcategories. Type **{{** to select from a list of variables and then they will start to appear using auto-complete. The **type** of the Variable is written on the right-hand side. You can add enriched data defined by the product.

## Using the Handlebars syntax[handlebars-syntax]
Handlebars is a simple templating language, allowing you to use dynamic content to customize your notification events.

When the template is executed (rendering process), the **Events Variables** are replaced with values from an input object.

The Handlebars language provides many features in addition to basic variable replacement, including evaluating [nested input objects](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#nested-input-objects) and functions, such as - iterations (loops), conditional statements, and more. In handlebars, these functions are called **“helpers”**

Helper Functions
Newrelic message-templates support all of Handlebars built-in helpers
In addition, New Relic has added other helpers that might be handy
Json
The {{json}} helper converts text to a JSON element.
It is extremely useful when configuring a Webhook’s payload that must form a Json syntax, and in any other situation you might want to pass a JSON field to your destination.
For example, given a variable called ‘data’.
{
   "data":{
      "tags":["infra, team-a"]
   }
}

To get the ‘names’ array as a Json element, use the {{json}} helper as follows:
{{json data.tags}}

and get
["infra","team-a"]

(see usage examples).
Equality
The {{eq}} helper compares String values or Variables
Compares variables a and b, renders 'yes' or 'no':

{{#eq a b}} yes {{else}} no {{/eq}}

Compares String value "a" to variable b, renders 'yes' or 'no':

{{#eq "a" b}} yes {{else}} no {{/eq}}

Renders 'true' or 'false':

{{eq a b}}

Render 'y' or 'n':

{{eq a b yes='y' no='n'}}

Usage Examples
The examples are based on the following variable called ‘data’.
"data":{
    "tags":["infra, team-a"],
    "id":123456789,
    "name": "Alice",
 }

Note that the above variable value has an equivalent, ‘dot-notated’ form:
"data.tags": ["infra, team-a"]
"data.id": 123456789
"data.name": "Alice"

If ‘id’ equals 123456789 output ‘valid’, if not, output 'not valid’
{{eq data.name "Alice" yes='valid' no = 'not valid'}}

result:
valid

Get the ‘tags’ and object’s properties in a JSON form
{{json data.tags}}

result:
["infra","team-a"]

Get the first tag from the ‘tags’ array
{{json data.tags.[0]}}

result:
"infra"

Iterate a variable of type Array and aggregate the values
{{#each tags}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}

result:
infra, team

Similar, iterate the ‘data’ Variable, aggregate the object’s values and output a Json element
{{#each (json data)}}{{this}}{{/each}}

result:
{
	"tags":["infra, team-a"],"name":"n","id":"Alice"
}

Similar, iterate the ‘data’ Variable, aggregate the object’s entries to a String
{{#each data}}{{@key}}: {{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}

result:
tags: infra,team-a, name: n, id: 123
