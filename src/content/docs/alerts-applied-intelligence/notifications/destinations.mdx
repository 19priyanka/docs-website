Destinations are unique identifiers for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send your notifications. Destination settings contain connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across a variety of tools in New Relic One.

The Supported destination platforms include:

* Email
* Jira
* ServiceNow
* Slack
* Webhook

For more on these destinations, see [notification integrations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/notification-integrations).

<Callout variant="tip">
  It's also possible to configure destinations using the `aiNotifications` [NerdGraph  API](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/get-started-nerdgraph-api-explorer/).
