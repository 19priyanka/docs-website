Destinations are unique identifiers for third-party systems. The destination you choose is the location where we send notifications.
New Relic Destination settings contain connection details to integrate with third-party systems and can be used across the applicable New Relic tools.

The Supported destination platforms include:

* Email
* Jira
* ServiceNow
* Slack
* Webhook

<Callout variant="tip">
  It's also possible to configure destinations using the `aiNotifications` [NerdGraph  API](https://developer.newrelic.com/collect-data/get-started-nerdgraph-api-explorer/).
