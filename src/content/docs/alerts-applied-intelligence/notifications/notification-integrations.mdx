  Send email notifications to users with and without new relic accounts. You do not need to create new destinations for emails, as they will be automatically added when picking users and email addresses from the event template.
  
## Configure the event template [#configure=event-template]
Users with New Relic accounts can be found using autocomplete by searching for the first or last name

To add a user without a new relic account or email distribution list, simply add the full email address.

**Send a test notification:**

You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example title and body to the emails defined.

  Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian that allows bug tracking and agile project management.
## Permissions [#permissions]
The required permissions from the API-Token are **‘create’**, **‘edit’** and **‘close’** tickets.
To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided API-Key should have an **‘Admin’** role.
## Setting up a Destination [#setting-up-destinations]
Create Jira Issues and let Jira and New Relic communicate back and forth to share updates  and stay synced.

To create a Jira Destination, enter the following information:
* :**Destination Name::** Custom name to identify the destination
* :**Jira account endpoint::** the URL of the destination
* :**User-name g:** this will be the email address of the user making the connection
* :**API Token:** generated from your attsiand account (how to generate an API token)

<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic currently support company managed projects
</Callout>

Before saving the Destination, it is recommended to test the connection by clicking the **‘test connection’** button.

##Two Way integration Sync [#two-way-integration]
To enable two-way sync, turn on the **‘two-way integration’** toggle. 
When turned on, a Jira Webhook would be created in your Jira account at a later stage, for the selected project (see ‘customize a message template’ below). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic API-KEY).


By default, any update to a Jira issue created by Newrelic will sync back to Newrelic. After enabling  two-way integration, when JIRA issue changes to closed the corresponding workflow issue will change to Closed.
##Configure the message template [#configure-message-template]

Upon successful connection, JIRA fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your JIRA instance. 

To help you get started, recommended fields and values are automatically presented. You can add or remove fields and change the values to customize the notification to your needs.


##Sending a test notification [#sending-test-notification]
Users can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, a JIRA ticket will be created and a link will appear.

    id="servicenow"
    title="ServiceNow"

  ServiceNow is a cloud based platform, which was mainly developed for workflow and process automation using the ITIL methodology. Integrate New Relic with Servicenow and automatically create and update Incidents on the destinations.
##Roles [#roles]

The Servicenow user details should have read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user, change_request Optional

An admin role is needed to enable two-way integration in Servicenow
##Setting up a Destination [#setting-up-a-destinations
To create a ServiceNow Destination, enter the following information:

* **Name::** Custom name to identify the destination
* **Domain:** the URL of the destination
* **User-name:**  the name of the user (needs to have the roles below)
* **Password**  the user name’s password 

##Two Way integration Sync [#two-way-integration]
You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow incidents so that when state updates for the incident (resolved or closed), it triggers an update in the corresponding New Relic Issue state. 

Here are some important steps to remember that are required when configuring the two-way integration:

1. Turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. 

2. Open and download this XML file (which includes the business rule triggering events back to Newrelic).

3. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rules

4. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded.

Before saving the Destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the **‘test connection’** button.

## Configure the message template [#configure-message-template]
Upon successful connection, Servicenow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Servicenow instance. 

To help you get started, recommended fields and values are automatically presented
You can add or remove fields and change the values to customize the notification to your needs.


**Send a test notification:**

You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload on from the channel, this will create an incident in Servicenow.

    <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="slack"
    title="Slack"
  >
  Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people to the information they need.
Send notifications to your dedicated slack channels. New Relic notifications enable you to notify the relevant channel.
## Prerequisites [#prereqs]
Your Slack workspace needs to have the [New Relic application](https://newrelic.slack.com/apps/AP92KQJS3-new-relic?tab=more_info) installed.
## Setting up a Destination [#setting-a-destination]
Use one-click slack authentication to enable slack



If you are not signed in to your workspace ,you will be redirected to slack to sign in.

Add your workspace name or choose the relevant workspace and click Continue


If you are signed in, choose the relevant workspace from the top right and click Allow




## Configure the message template [#configure-message-template]

At this stage, the notification message is pre-defined and cannot be changed. 


**Send a test notification:**

You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload on from the channel, this will create an incident in Servicenow.

    <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="webhook"
    title="Webhook"
  >
  Use the Webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like.   
##Setting up a Destination [#setting-a-destination]

To create a Webhook Destination, you need the following:
* **Name:** A unique Destination name
* **URL:** the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed.
* **Authorization:** ‘Basic authentication or a ‘Bearer token’ is needed
* Basic authentication allows users to provide the username and password associated with your HTTP endpoint, which will populate in the header.
* Bearer token involves security tokens, where the token is a cryptic string. The user must send this token in the authorization header when requesting protected resources

## Configure the event template [#configure-event-template]

Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the HTTP-POST request. 

The request configuration requires you too:
1. Set a name for the template.
2. Select a pre-configured Destination from the Destinations list (or create a new).
3. Add custom headers (optional)
4. Configure the request’s payload.

## Customize the payload [#customize-payload]
You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data.
Pick Variables from the Variables menu and apply handlebars syntax to enrich your webhook.
Note that the request’s content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to keep the JSON form. 
**The ‘preview’ section**
The ‘preview’ section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered.
