Alerts and applied intelligence are a suite of tools and features that proactively notify you when things go wrong in your system. And when they're starting to go wrong.

Alerts lets you define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, letting you focus on the things you care about most.

Applied intelligence is a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, automatically detects anomalies, and provides root cause analysis.

## Analyze [#analyze]

Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies.

The [overview page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page) shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations.

The **Issues & activity** page shows your most recent [issues](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#issues), [incidents](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#incidents), and [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#anomalies).

## Detect [#detect]

Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected.

The [alert conditions (policies) page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here.

The [anomaly detection page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/expanded-anomaly-detection/) lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here.

## Correlate [#correlate]

Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together.

The [sources page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#1-configure-sources) shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty.

The [decisions page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/) shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions.

## Enrich & notify [#enrich]

Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent.

Use the [muting rules page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/) to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications.

Use [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to add more data to your alerts notifications.

Use [destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#2-configure-destinations) to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent.

Use [pathways](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#3-configure-pathways) to configure where your correlated issues get sent.

Use [incident workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies.

Use [incident destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/) to add and configure third-party services for your incidents.

## Settings [#settings]

Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage.

## Alerts (classic) [#alerts]

Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using.

Use the [events and incidents pages](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents/) to review alerts violations and other events.

Use the [channels page](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/) for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels.
