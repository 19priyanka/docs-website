Alerts and applied intelligence are a suite of tools and features that proactively notify you when things go wrong in your system. And when they're starting to go wrong.

Alerts lets you define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, letting you focus on the things you care about most.

Applied intelligence is a machine-learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, automatically detects anomalies, and provides root cause analysis. Not only that, it enriches your notifications with metadata to give you greater context of what's happening when you are notified.

Use the sections below to help you understand how these tools work together and find the docs you need.

## **Analyze** your issues, incidents, and anomalies [#analyze]

Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies.

* The [overview](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page) shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations.
* **Issues and activity** shows your most recent [issues](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#issues), [incidents](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#incidents), and [anomalies](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page/#anomalies).

## **Detect** problems in your system [#detect]

Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected.

* [Alert conditions (policies)](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-policies/create-edit-or-find-alert-policy/) lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here.
* [Anomaly detection](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/proactive-detection/expanded-anomaly-detection/) lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here.

## **Correlate** the data coming into your system [#correlate]

Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together.

* [Sources](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#1-configure-sources) shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty.
* [Decisions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/change-applied-intelligence-correlation-logic-decisions/) shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions.

## **Enrich and notify** your notifications with useful metadata [#enrich]

Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent.

* Use [muting rules](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/muting-rules-suppress-notifications/) to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications.
* Use [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to add more data to your alerts notifications.
* Use [destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#2-configure-destinations) to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent.
* Use [pathways](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence/#3-configure-pathways) to configure where your correlated issues get sent.
* Use [incident workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/) to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies.
* Use [incident destinations](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/incident-intelligence-destination-examples/) to add and configure third-party services for your incidents.

## Use **Settings** to review and manage your usage [#settings]

Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage.

## **Alerts (classic)** [#alerts]

Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using.

* Use [events and incidents](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents/) to review alerts violations and other events.
* Use [channels](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-notifications/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts/) for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels.
