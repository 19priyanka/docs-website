To make the best use of New Relic alerting and applied intelligence features, it will help you to understand some basic terms and concepts. In the following explanation, the bolded words are important New Relic terms.

You can set up alerts for your telemetry data by configuring alert **conditions**, which define what will constitute a violation and trigger an **incident**. For example, you might want to create an alert condition that opens an incident if a host's CPU goes above 80%. Incidents result in an **issue**, which is the thing that actually results in notifications.

Conditions live inside an alert **policy**. The policy contains higher-level settings that govern all the conditions in that policy. One setting is **issue creation preference**, which governs how multiple incidents can get grouped into a single issue. For example, you might want incidents that happen very close together in time to be grouped together in the same issue. We have built-in **decisions**, which are algorithms that automatically group incidents into issues, and you can create your own custom decisions. 

Issues in turn can trigger **workflows**. A workflow is what gives you control over how issues are turned into notifications. **Destinations** are the services by which you get notified. We support common services like Slack, PagerDuty, ServiceNow, and also simple web hooks. It's good practice to carefully manage the setup of destinations so that users aren't creating redundant destinations.
