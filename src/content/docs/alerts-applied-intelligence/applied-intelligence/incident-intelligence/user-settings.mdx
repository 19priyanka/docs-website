metaDescription: "Use the incident intelligence settings to set your grace period and inactive issue time policies."
---

The incident intelligence general system settings page lets you set how much time our system spends observing new issue activity for the purpose of correlation. It also lets you decide how much time should pass before inactive issues are closed.

To find your user settings, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Alerts & AI > General**.

## Grace period policy [#grace-period]

The grace period is the time between when an issue is created and when it's activated. For each priority level, you can set the grace period between 0 and 20 minutes. The higher the time period, the more effectively our system analyzes new activity for correlation and to eliminate noise.

If you've set your incident preference to `By condition and signal`, your grace period is always 0 minutes.

Any notifications are sent when the grace period time has elapsed.

These settings apply to all data coming in to your account.

The default values are:

* Low: 15 minutes
* Medium: 10 minutes
* High: 5 minutes
* Critical: 1 minute

## Inactive issues policy [#inactive-issues]

The inactive issues policy controls how much time elapses before an inactive issue is closed. The range is from 1-30 days and the default value is 3 days.

This setting is related to the [close open violation setting](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-violations/how-alert-condition-violations-are-closed/#time-limit) for each condition.

When the settings are different, our system prioritizes the shorter value, regardless of the setting. For example, if the close open violation time was 2 days and the inactive issue time was 3 days, our system would wait 2 days before closing the issue.

## Idle issues versus inactive issues [#idle]

An issue can sometimes appear to be inactive, but actually be idle.

An issue is idling when one of these things occurs:

* No new incident has appeared in for 4 hours.
* The issue has collected 5,000 incidents.

An idle issue can be active for up to a maximum of 30 days.
