As part of [applied intelligence](/docs/introduction-new-relic-ai), incident intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events.

If you haven't already, [sign up for a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) to get started.

<Callout variant="important">
  Pathways have been deprecated, and are replaced by [workflows](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows/).

  If you still have access to Pathways on New Relic One, reach out to your New Relic account representative and ask to be upgraded.

## Set up incident intelligence [#get-started]

To enable incident intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed.

* [1. Configure your environment (one-time)](#1-configure-environment).
* [2. Configure sources](#1-configure-sources).
* [3. Configure destinations](#2-configure-destinations).
* [4. Configure workflows](#3-configure-workflows).

## 1. Configure your environment [#1-configure-environment]

An Environment is an account representing one or more accounts. It allows you to indicate to New Relic to store cross-account AI actions such as correlation, configuration and data into a particular account. The environment account should be one that your team's users have permissions to and are authorized to view the data in.

It is important to note that by default, each account is in its own environment if it was created after November 2021. This is the recommended setting. If your account was enabled on Incident Intelligence prior to November 2021, you would have one environment per master. You can change the settings as needed. Custom environments should be created only if cross account actions are required.

**What is stored in the Incident Intelligence Environment Account?**
* The Workflows (configuration)
* The Decisions (configuration)
* The Incidents
* The actual Issues that are created from Incidents
* This is also where Workflow’s enricher queries will be executed

**What is stored in each Individual Account?**
- The Policies and Conditions
- The Destinations

It's important to understand that when moving accounts from one environment to another, the configurations are not deleted, but they may not be available in the new environment.

<Callout variant="Important">
  In order to view Issues, the user must be authorized (read access) for the incident intelligence environment account.
In order to view an Incident's details, the user must be authorized (read access) to the account the incident originated in.
Consider giving read access to all users to the incident intelligence environment account.
</Callout>

**Create a custom environment**
To set up an environment in incident intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. The following steps should be taken:

* 1. Create a User API Key (link)
* 2. Go to the GraphQL explorer (US: https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql, EU: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql) for more details see here
* 3. Make sure the explorer is set at the top to Tools and that you picked the User key created in step 1.
* 4. Under the `mutation’ section, unfold `incidentIntelligenceEnvironment’ then select ‘incidentIntelligenceEnvironmentCreateEnvironment’
* 5. Follow the Nerd Graph documentation in the Nerd Graph explorer.


The incidentIntelligenceAccountId parameter is the account you will see in the UI when selecting an environment.
Not specifying the associatedAccountIds parameter will group all the accounts (that are not explicitly assigned to another environment) in the master-sub account hierarchy in the environment.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Incident intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events.
</Callout>

## 2. Configure sources [#1-configure-sources]

After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs.

You can get data from any of the following sources:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-nr-alerts"
    title="Alerts"
  >
    By integrating incident intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring.

    To get data from alerts:

    1. From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**, click **Alerts**.
    2. On the left under **incident intelligence**, click **Sources** and then click **Alerts**.
    3. Select the policies you want to connect to applied intelligence, and click **Connect**.

       You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in **Sources > Alerts**.

       <Callout variant="tip">
         Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications.

    title="Aporia (MLOps)"
  >
    By integrating incident intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our [docs](/docs/integrations/mlops-integrations/aporia-mlops-integration/).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-aporia"
    title="Superwise (MLOps)"
  >
    By integrating incident intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our [docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/mlops/integrations/superwise-mlops-integration/).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="configure-source-rest-api"
    title="REST API"
  >
    Incident intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event.

    * A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI.
    * An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe.

      You can also send any type of data to incident intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input.

      For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see [REST API for New Relic applied intelligence](/docs/rest-api-new-relic-ai).

## 3. Configure destinations [#2-configure-destinations]

Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations, which are the data outputs where you view your issues.

To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, [check the documentation on notifications](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/notifications/destinations/).

## 4. Configure workflows [#3-configure-workflows]

To learn how to set up workflows, [check our workflows docs](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-workflows/incident-workflows).
