[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/campaign/lightning/) has strict requirements about [Content Security Policy (CSP) v2](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/). In this situation, you must copy and paste the browser monitoring agent's JavaScript code and self-host it as a `.js` file. This allows the page to reference the `.js` file during page load.

## Requirements

In order to monitor Salesforce Lightning pages, make sure you follow these requirements:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **CSP and Salesforce Lightning**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Browser agent requirements**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Application or platform
      </td>

      <td>
        Your app or platform where your site is hosted must meet the standard [compatibility and requirements for browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-browser). **Exception:** CSP restrictions prevent you from linking an APM app for browser monitoring.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Subscription
      </td>

      <td>
        You must have a [**Pro+SPA** Browser subscription](https://newrelic.com/browser-monitoring/pricing) for your app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Host location for domains
      </td>

      <td>
        The `.js` file for for the agent must be hosted on a highly available or replicated location, such as a CDN or distributed network. This helps ensure performance is not affected. Follow the [Salesforce procedures](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=csp_trusted_sites.htm&type=5) to add our URLs to your CSP whitelist.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Browser agent version
      </td>

      <td>
        * Your selected app must use the [latest browser agent version](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes).
        * For SalesForce Lightning, you'll need to **manually update** the `.js` file when we release a new agent version. The agent doesn't update automatically for Salesforce Lightning apps.
      </td>
    </tr>

## 1. Whitelist browser monitoring domains [#csp-exception]

Follow the [Salesforce procedures](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=csp_trusted_sites.htm&type=5) to **both** of our browser monitoring domains to your CSP whitelist:

* `https://js-agent.newrelic.com`: This is where the  agent is hosted. The agent download requires three files to run. Two are downloaded after the initial agent is run to continue capturing performance data.
* `https://bam.nr-data.net`: This is the endpoint where the agent receives data from your site.

## 2. Copy your app's JS snippet [#js-snippet]

To create and host a `.js` file, you must first copy the browser agent's JavaScript snippet from the hosting app.

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **Browser**..
2. From the list of browser apps, select the app for which you want to self-host the agent.
3. Select **Settings > Application settings > Copy/paste JavaScript code**.
4. Copy the agent's JavaScript snippet.
5. Save and exit the **Application settings** page.

Continue with the procedures to create a `.js` file for your page.

## 3. Create .js file for page [#js-file]

After you copy the agent's JavaScript snippet from the selected app:

1. Open a text editor and paste the JavaScript snippet.
2. Delete the first line (`<script type="text/javascript">`) and the last line (`</script>`) of the JavaScript snippet.
3. Save the text file as `nr-spa-AGENT_VERSION.min.js`, where <var>AGENT_VERSION</var> is the [latest browser agent version](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes).
4. Upload the `.js` file to your [Salesforce external JavaScript libs directory](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/js_libs_platform.htm), and reference the `.js` file in the `<head>` of your webpage.

After you install the agent's JavaScript snippet, you can use the [browser monitoring UI](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) to monitor website performance.

## 4. Keep the agent up to date [#agent-update]

You must [manually update the `.js` file](#js-file) whenever we release a new the [Browser agent version](/docs/release-notes/new-relic-browser-release-notes/browser-agent-release-notes). The agent can't automatically update for Salesforce Lightning apps.
