Navigation for [docs.newrelic.com](https://docs.newrelic.com) is stored in `YAML` files located in the [`/src/nav/`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/nav) directory. Each top-level navigation should have its own configuration file. You'll most likely edit a version of this file in your branch and merge it into the `develop` branch.

## The configuration file

As an example, here's a snippet of the [`agents.yml`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/nav/agents.yml) navigation configuration. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. Be sure to imitate the same spacing when you make changes:

```yml
title: Agents
path: /docs/agents
pages:
  - title: Manage APM agents
    path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents
    pages:
      - title: Agent data
        path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data
        pages:
          - title: Real time streaming
            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming

            path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics
          - title: Manage errors

          - title: Link Kubernetes

      - title: App naming
        pages:

          - title: Use multiple names for an app

  Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep.

## Configuration file options

When you're changing the navigation, keep in mind that each node in the `.yml` configuration file can have the following properties:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width:200px">Key</th>
      <th>Required?</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`title`</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>The text that is shown in the navigation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`path`</td>
      <td>&#42;no</td>
      <td>
        <p>The URL path to the page. Do not use trailing slashes.</p>
        <p>
          &#42;Adding a `path` is required to generate auto index page content.
          See [path requirements below](#nav-requirements-for-auto-index-pages).
        </p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`children`</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>Any sub-navigation nodes.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When the user goes to a page, we determine which section of the site they are on and load the appropriate `.yml` file to populate the sidebar navigation. The navigation for the homepage is an aggregate of all the top-level pages.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Each category has its own `index.md` page (list of pages for that category).
  When updating the navigation, you may also want to update these pages to
  reflect the new information architecture more correctly.

## Use nav `YAML` to generate auto index content

On build we automatically generate an index page for each sub-directory in `src/content` that does not already have an `index.mdx` file and that has at least one `.mdx` or `.md` file in it. When creating the page we look through each nav `YAML` file for a reference to the path to know which nav data to use for the left nav and the auto index page content.

If an index page path is in more than one nav `YAML` file, we use the nav that matches its top level path with the beginning of index page path.

### Nav requirements for auto index pages

In order to populate the auto index page with nav `YAML` data, you must add the index page path somewhere in the most relevant nav `YAML` file. This helps the auto index page plugin determine which nav to attach to the index page, but also helps the `<IndexContents />` component know which section to display on the index page itself.

Each nav item must reference a directory path in `src/content` that contains at least one `.md` or `.mdx` file (otherwise the auto index plugin does not create a page for it).

<Callout variant="tip" title="Example">
  If this auto index page is used in `full-stack-observability.yml` and `integrations.yml`, we will attach the `integrations.yml` nav to it because:
  the top level `path` in the `integrations.yml` matches the beginning of the auto index page path:

```
title: Integrations
path: <mark>/docs/integrations</mark>
```

matches this auto index page path:

```
<mark>/docs/integrations</mark>/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list
```
