When you're writing in Markdown, keep in mind that indentation can make your mark-up more readable, and it can also affect how it is rendered in HTML.

## General tips for indenting lists [#general]

Here is a nested list with no parent indentation and two spaces for child bullets:

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 3a
  * Item 3b

Here is a nested numbered list with no indentation for parent and two spaces for child list:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  1. Item 3a
  2. Item 3b

Here is a nested bullet list that has no parent indentation and two spaces before child bullet:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  * Item 3a
  * Item 3b

Here is a nested bullet list that has no parent indentation and three spaces before child bullets:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b

Here is a nested bullet list where the parent starts at 4 spaces and children start at six (two beyond parent):

    * Item 1
    * Item 2
      * Item 3a
      * Item 3b

Here is a nested bullet list with four spaces before child bullets:

* Item 1
* Item 2
    * Item 3a
    * Item 3b

Here is a nested list with 2 spaces for parents and 4 spaces for child bullets:

  * Item 1
  * Item 2
    * Item 3a
    * Item 3b

Here is an example using four spaces everywhere:

1.  2 spaces after a numbered list.
    4 space indent for wrapped text.
2.  2 spaces again.

*   3 spaces after a bullet.
    4 space indent for wrapped text.
    1.  2 spaces after a numbered list.
        8 space indent for the wrapped text of a nested list.
    2.  Looks nice, don't it?
*   3 spaces after a bullet.

Here is an example using three spaces:

1. 2 spaces after a numbered list.
   4 space indent for wrapped text.
2. 2 spaces again.

*  3 spaces after a bullet.
   4 space indent for wrapped text.
   1.  2 spaces after a numbered list.
       8 space indent for the wrapped text of a nested list.
   2.  Looks nice, don't it?
*  3 spaces after a bullet.

## Indentation of consecutive procedures [#consecutive]

As long as consecutive procedures are left-justified, they behave as you might expect in Markdown. The following example shows how you'd set up two left-justified, consecutive lists in Markdown:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing left-justified consecutive procedures"
  alt="Screenshot showing left-justified consecutive procedures"
  src={indentLeftJustified}
/>

However, when you indent consecutive procedures, such as inside a collapser, Markdown does some unusual formatting:

* Markdown doesn't indent the introduction of the second procedure.
* Markdown starts the numbering of the second procedure based on the last number of the first procedure.

Here's an example of how the Markdown for same consecutive procedures are indented inside of a collapser. Note how the introduction for the second procedure isn't indented (see "You can also add...") and note how the numbering for the second procedure starts at 5:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="incorrect-formatting"
    title="Two consecutive lists with incorrect formatting"
  >
    When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity.

    To add or delete tags via the UI:

      1. Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host.
      2. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the **See metadata and manage tags** menu.
      3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.
      4. For APM agents, restart your service.

    You can also add or delete tags associated with a NRQL alert condition. To add or delete condition tags via the UI:

      1. Navigate to a condition.
      2. Near the condition’s name at the top of the form, click **Manage tags**.
      3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.

    To manage tags via API: see our [NerdGraph tagging docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial). For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see [our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/5-mins-tag-resources/).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

To avoid this unfortunate indentation and numbering, insert a second blank line feed so you have two line feeds separating the introductory sentence of the second procedure from the last numbered item of the first list. Here's now that mark-up looks:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing where to add extra line feed"
  alt="Screenshot showing where to add extra line feed"
  src={indentExtraLineFeed}
/>

Here is how this Markdown is rendered in HTML:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="correct-formatting"
    title="Two consecutive lists with correct formatting"
  >

## Code snippets in procedures [#code-snippet-indentation]

When you have a code snippet in a numbered list, indent snippets so they match the indentation of their parent steps. Also, we recommend you use even-numbered indentation (with tabs composed of two spaces):

1. Save the following as `otel-config.yaml`:

  ```
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        http:

  processors:
    batch:

  exporters:
    otlp:
      endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
      headers:
        api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
      metrics:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
      logs:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
  ```

2. Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes:
   * Replace <var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var> with the appropriate [endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic#review-settings).
   * Replace <var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var> with your account's [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).

  ```
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var>
  export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var>

  docker run --rm \
    -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
    -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \
    -p 4317:4317 \
    -v "${PWD}/otel-config.yaml":/otel-config.yaml \
    --name otelcol \
    otel/opentelemetry-collector \
    --config otel-config.yaml
  ```
