When you're writing in Markdown, indentation can make your mark-up more readable. Indentation can also affect the file's readability when it's rendered in HTML. This doc covers how to handle parent (first-level), child (second-level), and grandchild (third-level) lists. We will also demonstrate how to insert spaces to better incorporate code blocks, images, and nested lists within a set of procedures. ```

## First-level lists (parents) [#first-level]

For first-level lists introduced by a left-justified introductory sentence, we follow Markdown standard: left-justify the first-level list items. At publication, the Markdown library will indent the first-level list items for you:

```
Here is a basic list written as left-justified but indented at the time of publication:
* Item 1
* Item 2
```

This is rendered like this:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing poor formatting of child bullet list"
  alt="Screenshot showing poor formatting of child bullet list"
  src={basicListIndentationLeft}
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
  You may see some cases in our Markdown where there's two-space indentation for first-level lists. This works on the first level for lists, but it is less semantically accurate.
</Callout>

## How indent second- and third-level lists [#second-and-third]

For child or grandchild lists, insert four spaces (or two two-space tabs) to precede the bullet point or number. While you can use three or four spaces to indent child lists, we recommend the four space or two tab method, as they render lists more consistently.

<Callout variant="important">
  Do not use two-space indentation for any level of list items. While these work in some contexts, they are not predictable. See our [two-space examples](#two-space).
</Callout>

**Example: Four-space indentation for child (recommended):**

We recommend this since it uses multiples of two spaces:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
    * Item 2a
    * Item 2b
```

<img
  title="Screenshot showing four-space formatting for child"
  alt="Screenshot showing four-space formatting for child"
  src={fourSpaceIndentChild}
/>

**Example: Three-space indentation:**

This works but it's more difficult to type because you have to use a combination of a tab and space to get three total spaces:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
   * Item 2a
   * Item 2b
```

<img
  title="Screenshot showing three-space formatting for child"
  alt="Screenshot showing three-space formatting for child"
  src={threeSpaceIndentChild}
/>

## Problems with two-space indentation for lists [#two-space]

While there are some cases where two-space indentation works, such as indenting images or for parent and child bullet lists, your results in other cases can unpredictable. Here's an example of two-space indentation of a child list. Note that the Markdown library doesn't indent either of these child lists:

**Example: Child bullet list**

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

Note that it renders the child bullets, but they are not indented:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing poor formatting of child bullet list"
  alt="Screenshot showing poor formatting of child bullet list"
  src={childBulletList}
/>

**Example: Child numbered list**

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  1. Item 2a
  2. Item 2b
```
Note that the Markdown converter can't tell the indented list is a child:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing poor formatting of child numbered list"
  alt="Screenshot showing poor formatting of child numbered list"
  src={childNumberedList}
/>

## Bullets nested in numbered list [#bullets-nested-in-numbers]

When you next bulleted lists under number lists, be sure to pay attention to the child indentation. Look at the example below where the initial child bullet list is not fully indented:

The process consists of four activities:
1. Review AQM dashboard and KPI trends: Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends. The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement.
2. Identify achievements, challenges, and opportunities: Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes.
3. Incident policy review: Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies. Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below.
4. Alert policy recommendations: In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria:
  * Do the alerts have any business impact?
  * Are the policies properly configured?
    * Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed?
    * Are the policies necessary? Do they have business impact?
    * Are the thresholds set properly?
5. Technical recommendations: Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including:
   * Are there application / system problems for engineering to review?
   * Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed?
   * Are there instrumentation gaps?

Here is the same content but with four spaces to next the first bullet:

## Indentation of consecutive procedures [#consecutive]

As long as consecutive procedures are left-justified, they behave as you might expect in Markdown. The following example shows how you'd set up two left-justified, consecutive lists in Markdown:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing left-justified consecutive procedures"
  alt="Screenshot showing left-justified consecutive procedures"
  src={indentLeftJustified}
/>

However, when you indent consecutive procedures, such as inside a collapser, Markdown does some unusual formatting:

* Markdown doesn't indent the introduction of the second procedure.
* Markdown starts the numbering of the second procedure based on the last number of the first procedure.

Here's an example of how the Markdown for same consecutive procedures are indented inside of a collapser. Note how the introduction for the second procedure isn't indented (see "You can also add...") and note how the numbering for the second procedure starts at 5:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="incorrect-formatting"
    title="Two consecutive lists with incorrect formatting"
  >
    When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity.

    To add or delete tags via the UI:

      1. Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host.
      2. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the **See metadata and manage tags** menu.
      3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.
      4. For APM agents, restart your service.

    You can also add or delete tags associated with a NRQL alert condition. To add or delete condition tags via the UI:

      1. Navigate to a condition.
      2. Near the condition’s name at the top of the form, click **Manage tags**.
      3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.

    To manage tags via API: see our [NerdGraph tagging docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial). For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see [our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/5-mins-tag-resources/).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

To avoid this unfortunate indentation and numbering, insert a second blank line feed so you have two line feeds separating the introductory sentence of the second procedure from the last numbered item of the first list. Here's now that mark-up looks:

<img
  title="Screenshot showing where to add extra line feed"
  alt="Screenshot showing where to add extra line feed"
  src={indentExtraLineFeed}
/>

Here is how this Markdown is rendered in HTML:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="correct-formatting"
    title="Two consecutive lists with correct formatting"
  >

## Code snippets in procedures [#code-snippet-indentation]

When you have a code snippet in a numbered list, indent snippets so they match the indentation of their parent steps (typically two spaces). Also, we recommend you use even-numbered indentation (with tabs composed of two spaces):

1. Save the following as `otel-config.yaml`:

  ```
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        http:

  processors:
    batch:

  exporters:
    otlp:
      endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
      headers:
        api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
      metrics:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
      logs:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
  ```

2. Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes:
   * Replace <var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var> with the appropriate [endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic#review-settings).
   * Replace <var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var> with your account's [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).

  ```
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var>
  export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var>

  docker run --rm \
    -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
    -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \
    -p 4317:4317 \
    -v "${PWD}/otel-config.yaml":/otel-config.yaml \
    --name otelcol \
    otel/opentelemetry-collector \
    --config otel-config.yaml
  ```

## Image indentation [#images]

Images under list items should be indented the same as their parents. This shows the reader that the image is directly tied to that list item. Here's an example where the first image doesn't use the same indentation as the parent list item. The second image is indented correctly:

```
1. First, New Relic gathers all relevant incidents. This includes incidents where [decision-logic steps 1 and 2](#build-decision) are true, and that are also within the defined time window in advanced settings.

<img
  title="topology-1.png"
  alt="New Relic topology explained 1"
  src={topology1}
/>

<figcaption>
  In this example, all of the incidents in the dotted-line selection have met these requirements: they've gone through the [decision logic in steps 1 and 2](#build-decision), and all contextual comparisons made in [decision logic step 2](#build-decision) are true.
</figcaption>

2. Next, we attempt to associate each incident to a vertex in your [topology graph](#create-topology-graph) using a vertex's defining attributes and the available attributes on the incident.

  <img
    title="topology-2.png"
    alt="New Relic topology explained 2"
    src={topology2}
  />
