This page is for release notes for downloadable software. For product announcements, see [What's new style guidelines](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/whats-new-style-guidelines/).

## New release note [#new-note]

<Callout variant="tip">
  To avoid potential naming conflicts, use a `-` separator in your file name. For example, Node.js agent v1.2.3 would result in the name `node-agent-1-2-3`. If there was no separator, a future 12.3 version could collide with 1.2.3.
</Callout>

To add a release note to the site:

1. Find the most recent release note for your agent and make a copy of it.
2. Use our file naming convention to ensure your numbering system does not conflict with your other release notes.
3. Fill in the `subject`, `releaseDate`, and `version`. If applicable, include `downloadLink` and `watermark` fields.
4. Write the content for your new release note, following the established pattern.
5. Commit your changes and submit a pull request.

A Tech Docs hero will review your release note content and approve your pull request to get it published.

We build and deploy the Docs site a few times a day, and sometimes builds can take a few hours to complete. If your release is time-sensitive, ensure you've planned for enough time to get your docs live.

## New release notes category [#new-category]

This information is primarily for the Tech Docs team's use.

To add a new release notes category, update the following areas of the Docs site. (You do not need to update the `releaseNote.js` or `releaseNoteLandingPage.js` files in the `nav/templates` folder.) Before you submit your pull request to the GitHub docs site, check that the landing pages and placeholder release note build correctly in your localhost.

### Category landing page

In `/src/content/docs/release-notes`, add the following:

* A folder for your new release notes category. The RSS feed link, page format, and date order for release notes listed on this page are generated automatically. For example, see the [C SDK category landing page format](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/c-sdk-release-notes/).
* An `index.mdx` file in your new folder containing the `subject`. The `subject` is the name that will appear on the [Release notes landing page](/docs/release-notes/).
* A [placeholder release note](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/create-release-notes/#new-note) in this folder for the agent team to fill out. If used, the `downloadLink` field in the release note will be formatted automatically in the published release note.

Before the new category goes live, check with the team's Product Marketing Management (PMM) rep whether they want to include the link in an upcoming [What's new post](/docs/style-guide/article-templates/whats-new-style-guidelines/). 

### Landing page

In `/src/content/docs/release-notes/index.mdx`, add a new tile section in alphabetical order for your release notes category.

Example:

```
<TechTile
  name="Logs"
  icon="logo-newrelic"
  to="/docs/release-notes/logs-release-notes"
/>
```

Logos come from `@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/logo/`. If a logo does not already exist for the new agent, use the standard `logo-newrelic` icon or an image in `@newrelic/gatsby-theme-newrelic/icons/feathers.js`. If you need other options, talk to the team's designer.

### Links from other categories

Add a link to your new release notes category in the agent's documentation, typically in its `Get started` category. For more information, see our documentation about [docs in multiple menus](/docs/style-guide/processes-procedures/include-a-doc-in-multiple-menus/).

Optional: Add a link in the agent's landing page text by updating the `index.mdx` file in its taxonomy.
