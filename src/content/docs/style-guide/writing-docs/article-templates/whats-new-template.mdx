If you're a New Relic employee and want to make an announcement to customers about a new feature, one option is to use "What's new." This is a carefully curated channel of timely, high-level announcements of major features. 

"What's new" posts supplement release notes and technical product deep-dives in our blog posts and community forums. The posts appear in the [New Relic UI](https://onenr.io/0Zyw4MX1MR3) (behind the megaphone icon) and the [docs site](/whats-new/).

The process to get a post published takes from one to three days and looks like this:

1. You submit your "What's new" PR (pull request) to the docs website.
2. A product marketing manager reviews your post and may suggest improvements.
3. The product marketing manager hands your work off to the technical documentation team for final review and publication.

As you go through these steps, if you need more help with the format of the post, check out our [detailed template](#detailed-template) below.

## Before you start [#before-you-start]

Here are some tips to ensure a smooth process:

* These instructions refer to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use any text editor you like.
* If you don’t already have one, create a personal GitHub account (not for Enterprise GitHub).
* The following instructions tell you how to do most of this directly in the GitHub UI, but if you are familiar with Git, you can push your changes from your computer using the command line, GitHub CLI, GitHub Desktop, or related tools.

## Prepare your “What’s new” files [#create-a-file]

"What's new" posts consist of a Markdown file (`.md`) explaining the feature, along with optional image files.

Here's how to prepare your post and images:

1. In VS Code, create a new file by clicking  **File > New File**. 
2. Copy this simple example post (CTRL + A) and paste it (CTRL + V) into the new, empty file. If you prefer to start with a template that has a wider-range of examples, you can copy the [detailed template](#detailed-template) instead.

title: 'Control data ingest costs with ingest drill-down'
summary: 'Analyze the data that you send to New Relic'
releaseDate: '2021-06-30'
learnMoreLink: 'https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic/#facet-data-ingest'
getStartedLink: 'https://one.newrelic.com/-/0gbRKzygzwE'

Inspect your data consumption in New Relic to better manage your data ingest and costs. Understand your data usage by each data source, and analyze it using your existing metadata, such as by source, team, and any other data sample attribute.

To get started, go to the **Data management hub** and select the **Data ingestion chart**. Get detailed insights by data source by clicking on the colored data band at any point in time that you’re interested in. Add "facets" to analyze your data by selected attributes. [**Learn more**](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic/#facet-data-ingest) and [**get started**](https://one.newrelic.com/-/0gbRKzygzwE).

![To find your data ingest usage, click the account dropdown, click Manage your data, then click Data ingestion.](./images/ingest_drill_down_1_of_2.png "A screenshot that shows how to find your data ingest consumption.")

<figcaption>To find your data ingest consumption, click Manage your data, then click Data ingestion.</figcaption>

![Choose a specific data source to drill down into what's contributing the most to your data ingest consumption.](./images/ingest_drill_down_2_of_2.png "A screenshot that shows the data ingest by data source dropdown.")

<figcaption>Click the chart to see ingestion by data source.</figcaption>
```
3. Replace the example content with details from your post. Don't forget to change the front matter entries at the top!
4. Save the file to a convenient working directory and give it a name with this format: `whats-new-MM-DD-descriptive-words.md`(for example, `whats-new-5-28-in-context-alerting.md`).
5. Save the images you reference in your Markdown to the same working directory on your computer. 
    * Be sure to remove spaces in your image file names. 
    * Although your images on your local computer can be in the same directory as the Markdown file, when you eventually upload them, you'll put them in an `images` directory. This is why you need to precede the name of the image in the Markdown with `./images/`.

## Create or update a fork of the docs site

A fork is just a copy of the entire docs repository that will reside in your personal GitHub account. You'll add your changes into the fork, and then make a PR (pull request) asking us to merge the changes in your fork with the New Relic `develop` branch.

1. If you’ve never forked the docs site, go to [https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website), and click **Fork** at the top right corner of the page.

![Screenshot showing fork button](./images/fork.png "Screenshot showing fork button")

2. If you already have a fork of the docs site, update your repo by clicking **Fetch upstream** and then clicking the green **Fetch and merge** button.

![Screenshot showing fetch upstream button](./images/fetch-upstream.png "Screenshot showing fetch upstream button")

## Create a branch [#create-branch]

Once you have a fork, create a new branch for your post.

1. Click **develop**. 

![Screenshot showing the box to create a branch](./images/create-a-branch.png "Screenshot showing the box to create a branch")

2. In the **Find or create a branch....** box, enter a name for your new branch: ‘whats-new-[number of month]-[day]-[feature name]’ (for example, whats-new-10-25-aggregation-methods) and click **Create branch: [name you created in the box for your branch] from 'develop'**. 

![Screenshot showing fetch upstream button](./images/create-a-branch-2.png  "Screenshot showing fetch upstream button")

## Upload your "What's new" Markdown file [#upload-md]

In this step, you click through various GitHub directories to find the appropriate one for the year and month of your post.

1. Click the **src** folder.

![Screenshot showing the src folder](./images/src-folder.png "Screenshot showing the src folder")

2. Click the **content** folder. 

![Screenshot showing the content folder](./images/content-folder.png "Screenshot showing the content folder")

3. Click the **whats-new** folder.

![Screenshot showing the what's new folder](./images/whats-new-folder.png "Screenshot showing the what's new folder")

4. Click the folder for the current-year, followed by the folder for the current month (for example, **January = 01**; **February = 02**; etc.).

5. Once you reach the directory for the appropriate year and month, click **Add File** and then **Upload files**.

![Screenshot showing the Add file button](./images/upload-files-content.png "Screenshot showing the add file button")

6. Drag the “What’s new” file from your Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows) to the upload box or click **choose your files** and select your file.

![Screenshot showing the drag and drop box](./images/drag-files-content.png "Screenshot showing the drag and drop box")

7. Under **Commit changes**, enter a conventional commit message that follows this pattern: `feat(whats-new): your-post-in-a-few-words`. This format tells us you’re adding a post about a feature (feat). Example: `feat(whats-new): add automap post`. 
 
8. Select the option to **Commit directly to the [name of your branch] branch**, and then click the green **Commit changes** button.

![Screenshot showing the commit changes button](./images/commit-changes-content.png "Screenshot showing the commit changes button").

<Callout variant="important">
Do not click the **Compare and pull request** green button in the yellow banner that appears at the top of your screen. You’ll do this later!
</Callout>

## Upload your image files [#add-images]

Images are not required, but if you have them, the routine is similar to uploading your Markdown file:

1. Click the **src** folder. 

![Screenshot showing the src folder](./images/src-folder.png "Screenshot showing the src folder")

2. Click the **content** folder. 

![Screenshot showing the content folder](./images/content-folder.png "Screenshot showing the content folder")

3. Click the **whats-new** folder.

![Screenshot showing the what's new folder](./images/whats-new-folder.png "Screenshot showing the what's new folder")

4. Click the folder for the current-year, followed by the folder for the current month (for example, **January = 01**; **February = 02**; etc.).

5. Click the **images** folder. 

6. To upload your image files, click **Add file** and **Upload files**.

![Screenshot showing the Upload files button](./images/upload-files-image.png "Screenshot showing the Upload files button")

7. Drag the image(s) file(s) from your Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows) to the space or click **choose your files** and select the image(s) file(s). 

![Screenshot showing upload box](./images/drag-files-images.png "Screenshot showing upload box")

8. Under **Commit changes**, enter a conventional commit message similar to what you did for the Markdown file (for example: `feat(whats-new): add automap images`). 

9. Select the option to **Commit directly to the [name of your branch] branch**, and then click the green **Commit changes** button. 

![Screenshot showing commit box](./images/commit-changes-images.png "Screenshot showing commit box")

## Create a PR [#create-pr]

The PR (pull request) is the way you start the process to request a merge of your changes into the the main docs web site. 

1. Click **Compare &amp; pull request** that appears at the top of your screen.  

![Screenshot showing the pull request button](./images/create-pull-request.png "Screenshot showing ushowing the pull request button")

2. In the main field, create a brief title for the PR (for example, `"What's new" automap post`).

3. In the **Write** tab, replace the writing prompts with any instructions you have about the post. For example, include the date and time it should be published.

4. Click **Create pull request**.

![Screenshot showing the button to create the pull request](./images/create-pull-request-button.png "Screenshot showing the button to create the pull request")

5. If you haven't already signed the CLA (contributor license agreement), you get a prompt in the PR reminding you to sign it. Make sure you sign this to ensure the PR is accepted:

![Screenshot showing the prompt to sign the CLA agreement](./images/cla-signature.png "Screenshot showing the prompt to sign the CLA agreement")

After you complete the PR, one of the Product Marketing Managers will review the post and reach out to you with any concerns. Once they approve it, they will pass it to the docs team to make finishing touches and publish it. If you need additional help, ask our documentation hero.

## A detailed template [#detailed-template]

Here is a thorough template showing you a wide range of formatting options and tips for your Markdown post. You can either use it for reference, or you can paste this into your new post and replace the prompts with your own content. 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="template"
    title="Detailed template"
  >
```

title: 'Insert a title here' 
summary: 'Insert a brief description of the feature' 
releaseDate: 'yyyy-mm-dd' 
learnMoreLink: 'https://example.com' 
getStartedLink: 'https://example.com'
---
## Front matter tips 

The front matter is the group of lines at the top of the post before your content begins. The front matter is sandwiched between lines containing three dashes. Here's what you need to know about each front matter line:

* title (required): The title field is how your readers will browse through "What's new" and find what interests them. Make your titles as short as possible and include the most relevant product and feature names. The more specific you get, the more likely people will be to read the post. As with other pages on the site, use sentence case for titles (Only one capital letter at the beginning of the title). 
* summary (required): A brief description of the feature that appears directly under the title in the left sidebar and at the top of the post. Make sure your summary is a single sentence and isn't more than about 10-20 words.
* releaseDate (required): The date a feature is released. "What's new" posts are organized chronologically. This controls where a post will show on the list. If you have two or more posts on the same date, use the time field to control the post order.
* learnMoreLink (optional): Learn more links are used to highlight blog posts or other marketing material that provides more information about the feature. Remove this if you are not using it!
* getStartedLink (optional): This is a link to to documents that explain how to set up the feature. Remove this if you are not using it!

## Word wrap

If you're using VS Code and want to turn on text wrapping:

* Windows: Ctrl + Shift + press the key `P`. Now on the command line, type Toggle Word Wrap and press Enter.
* Mac: Command + Shift + press the key `P`. Now in the command line, type Toggle Word Wrap and press Enter.

## Heading format 

Headings are not required, but they are helpful if you need to divide the material into at least two sections. We don't recommend headings unless you use them in pairs.

Headings are preceded by two hash symbols and a space. Use sentence case, which means only one capital letter at the beginning.

## Body format

Format for the body:

The body ranges from 150-400 words and is where you tell the story about your new feature. Each 

TIP: If possible, include one or more screenshots or a video.

The goal of the What's new post is to inform people about the feature. Here are some questions to keep in mind:

* What is the most important idea to communicate about this feature?
* What problem does this feature solve?
* How does it make using New Relic easier?
* What's delightful about it?
* Can you add a great, visually appealing screenshot or video?

Don't include procedural how-to content. Use `getStartedLink` and `learnMoreLink` in the front matter to link to information about how to use the feature.

## Links

[Lorem ipsum](https://example.com)-You can have spaces between words in square brackets but not in the link inside parentheses.

WARNING: Remember to use absolute URLs in links (for example, always include the protocol followed by the domain: "https://whatever_domain/path-to-doc")–including references to the New Relic docs site.

## Videos

Use embed code. The example below is an embedded YouTube video. You would replace the value for src with your link:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/04JP0ky_hjI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Images

![Insert some alternative text here describing the image](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME "Repeat the alternative text here as the title of the image")

Example: !["Screenshot showing automap feature"](./images/automap.png "Screenshot showing automap feature")

Remember to add your image(s) to "images" folder in the Github pull request. 

## Bold format

Use double asterisks to bold words for UI labels or simply for emphasis: **bold**

## Lists

Use this format to create an ordered list (used for sequential steps):
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

Use this format to create bullet lists (used for non-sequential information):
* Important detail
* Important detail
* Important detail
```
