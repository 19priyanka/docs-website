Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. There are several things you need to do get this working. Fortunately, you only need to do this once.

## 0. Enable VS Code in your terminal

It's handy to be able to open files from your terminal directly in VS Code. You may only use this a couple of times, but it's much nicer than trying to edit files in the terminal itself.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Press **command + shift + p** to open the command palette, then type "install code", and then click **Shell command: Install 'code' command in PATH**.
3. In your terminal, type `code <var>filename</var>` to open that file in VS Code.

## 1. Set up GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is a graphical tool for managing your branches, commits, and PRs. It's probably the most straightforward way to work with git and GitHub.

1. Install GitHub Desktop.
2. Sign in to GitHub Desktop via your GitHub account.
    - On Macs, click on **GitHub Desktop** in the top left corner of your screen and select **Preferences**. Select the blue **Sign In** button and follow the prompts in the browser window. 
3. Navigate to the [Docs Site repository](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website). 
4. Click the green **Code** button and select **Open with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)**. 
5. Choose the location where you want the repo. The default location for this folder is `~/Documents/github`.
6. Clone the entire repository to your local machine.

## 2. Enable Full Disk Access

By default, it seems that macOS prevents the terminal from access to certain system folders, like `Documents`. Change this setting to make it easier to navigate in your file system via the terminal.

1. Open System Preferences.
2. Click **Security & Privacy**.
3. In the left pane scroll down until you find **Full Disk Access** and then select it.
4. Click the lock in the bottom left corner and then enter the password you use to log in to your computer.
5. In the list of apps, check the box next to **Terminal** (or whatever your default terminal application is).
6. Click the lock to lock it.

## 3. Install Homebrew

Homebrew is command line tool for installing other applications. It's also an easy way to keep command line software updated.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Copy and paste this command to your terminal:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

## 4. Install npm
npm stands for Node package manager. You use this to install nvm, which stands for Node version manager.

1. In your terminal, type `brew install npm`.

## 5. Install nvm

Node version manager, or nvm, is what you use to manage the version of Node installed on your computer.

1. In your terminal, type `npm i -g nvm`.

## 6. Add nvm to your shell profile

In order to run the commands you need for your local build, you need to add the path to nvm to your shell profile. 

On macOS, your shell is what interprets what you enter on the command line. The default macOS shell is Zsh. You need to tell your shell the directory where nvm is on your machine, so you can run these commands from anywhere.

You do this by adding some text to your `.zshrc` file, which is a config file for your shell.

1. In your terminal, type `code ~/.zshrc` to open this file in VS Code.
2. In the .zshrc file, copy and paste this text:
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
```
3. Save the file.

## 7. Install Node

Once you've installed nvm, you can install the correct version of Node. Node, or Node.js, is the JavaScript engine that powers our Gatsby site and its dependencies.

1. In your terminal, type `nvm use 16` to install Node version 16.

## 8. Install Yarn

Yarn is another package manager used to compile all of the files in the docs-website repo to build the site locally. You use npm to install Yarn.

1. In your terminal, type `npm i -g yarn`.

## Build the site locally

Once you've installed all of these things in your terminal, you can run the site locally on your machine.

1. In your terminal, type `yarn` to make sure all your Gatsby dependencies are up to date.
2. Type `yarn start` to build the site locally.
