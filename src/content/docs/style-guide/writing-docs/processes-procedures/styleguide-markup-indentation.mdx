Let's look at various indentation issues:

* Indenntation of code snippets
* Indentation of back-to-back procedures
* Indentation of images

## Indentation of back-to-back procedures [#back-to-back]

Here's an example of two separate procedures that follow each other in a collapser. To ensure that the two numbered lists are numbered separately and are not treated as one list, you have two options:

  * Insert a `<br/>` tag between the two lists and use a single tab of two spaces for each list item (shown in the snippet below)
  * Ignore the indentation of the collapsers and just left-justify the introductory sentences and use a single tab of two spaces for each list item. This makes the Markdown a bit harder to read.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="add-via-ui-api"
    title="Add tags via UI or API"
  >
    When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity.

    To add or delete tags via the UI:

      1. Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host.
      2. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the **See metadata and manage tags** menu.
      3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.
      4. For APM agents, restart your service.
    <br/>
    You can also add or delete tags associated with a NRQL alert condition. RAS.  To add or delete condition tags via the UI:

      1. Navigate to a condition.
      2. Near the condition’s name at the top of the form, click **Manage tags**.
      3. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag.

    To manage tags via API: see our [NerdGraph tagging docs](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-tagging-api-tutorial). For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see [our developer site](https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/5-mins-tag-resources/).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Here's the mark-up for the `<br/>` option:

  alt="Screenshot showing the usage of break"
  src={indentInCollapserBR}
/>

Here's the mark-up for left-justification:

  alt="Screenshot showing the usage of break"
  src={indentInCollapserLeft}
/>

## Code snippets in procedures [#code-snippet-indentation]

When you have a code snippet in a numbered list, make sure that you use even-numbered indentation (two, four, or six spaces):

1. Save the following as `otel-config.yaml`:

  ```
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
        http:

  processors:
    batch:

  exporters:
    otlp:
      endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
      headers:
        api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
      metrics:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
      logs:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [otlp]
  ```

2. Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes:
   * Replace <var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var> with the appropriate [endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic#review-settings).
   * Replace <var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var> with your account's [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).

  ```
  export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var>
  export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var>

  docker run --rm \
    -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
    -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \
    -p 4317:4317 \
    -v "${PWD}/otel-config.yaml":/otel-config.yaml \
    --name otelcol \
    otel/opentelemetry-collector \
    --config otel-config.yaml
  ```

Here is a screenshot of this indentation:

## Images in bullets or numbered lists [#images]

Here's an example of code with images:
<img
  title="Diagram showing a direct export to New Relic to your app"
  alt="Diagram showing a direct export to New Relic to your app"
  src={nativeOtlpNoCollector}
/>

<figcaption>
  BillyBBThe OTLP exporter in your service can export directly to the New Relic OTLP receiver.
</figcaption>

You have two choices for exporting data to New Relic via OTLP:

* Directly from your app TEST:

  <img
    title="Diagram showing a direct export to New Relic to your app"
    alt="Diagram showing a direct export to New Relic to your app"
    src={nativeOtlpNoCollector}
  />

  <figcaption>
    The OTLP exporter in your service can export directly to the New Relic OTLP receiver.
  </figcaption>

* Export from an OpenTelemetry collector:

  <img
    title="Diagram showing the export to New Relic from a collector"
    alt="Diagram showing the export to New Relic from a collector"
    src={nativeOtlpWithCollector}
  />

  <figcaption>
    You can set up the collector as a gateway that receives, processes, and exports to the New Relic OTLP receiver. Alternatively, you can set up the collector as an agent that runs with your application or runs on the same host.

## Indentation of basic lists [#basic-list]

Here is a basic list with a space following the intro and no manual indentation of the list:

* Item one
* Item two

Here is a second basic list with no space following the introductory text and a single-tab (two spaces for indentation of bullets):
  * Item one
  * Item two

Here is a third basic list with no space following the introductory text and a three space indentation:
   * Item one
   * Item two

Here is another three space indentation example:

1. Save the following as `otel-config.yaml`:

   ```
   receivers:
     otlp:
       protocols:
         grpc:
         http:

   processors:
     batch:

   exporters:
     otlp:
       endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT}
       headers:
         api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY}

   service:
     pipelines:
       traces:
         receivers: [otlp]
         processors: [batch]
         exporters: [otlp]
       metrics:
         receivers: [otlp]
         processors: [batch]
         exporters: [otlp]
       logs:
         receivers: [otlp]
         processors: [batch]
         exporters: [otlp]
   ```

2. Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes:
   * Replace <var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var> with the appropriate [endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/collector/opentelemetry-collector-basic#review-settings).
   * Replace <var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var> with your account's [license key](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.launcher).

   ```
   export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=<var>OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE</var>
   export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=<var>YOUR_KEY_HERE</var>

   docker run --rm \
     -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \
     -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \
     -p 4317:4317 \
     -v "${PWD}/otel-config.yaml":/otel-config.yaml \
     --name otelcol \
     otel/opentelemetry-collector \
     --config otel-config.yaml
   ```
