Installing New Relic is a crucial piece in our customer's experience. A failure to install something not only prevents our customers from using New Relic, but it almost certainly guarantees they won't be our customers eventually. Whether it's installing APM agents, the infrastructure agent, sending us logs, or installing CodeStream, among other things.

This doc is intended to help you decide where to send your reader when they want to install something.

## An overview of installation methods [#overview]

Currently, we have three methods our customers can use to install New Relic and start monitoring something:

1. Guided install
2. Manual installation via the “+ Add more data” page in the UI
3. Manual installation via the docs site

Instant observability (I/O) is **not** an installation method. It simply provides a catalog of all of the things that someone could potentially monitor via New Relic. An instant observability page simply points to one of these three methods, depending on what's available.

CodeStream has its own installation method.

## Guided install [#guided]

Guided install provides a single command you can run on your system to install New Relic and start monitoring a variety of things. 

At present, guided install installs the infrastructure agent, configures a certain set of integrations, and enables sending logs. It also detects integrations on your system and prompts you to choose whether to monitor those integrations or not.

For the docs, we should send people to guided install, whenever it's appropriate to do so. That is, when guided install is likely to lead to a successful outcome. 

## Manual installation via add more data [#manual-add]

The **Add more data** pages provide a simple and straightforward installation path for people wanting to install APM agents and who are using the most popular integrations and most common system settings for those integrations. 

**Add more data** populates installation configuration files with values like app name and API key so that a customer doesn't have to track down that information. They also provide the most straightforward installation path for standard use cases.

This method is less good for customers who have more complicated or obscure things they're trying to monitor or non-standard systems.

**Add more data** also has the advantage of living in the UI.

## Manual installation via the docs site [#manual-docs]

This should be the method of last resort. The installation instructions on the docs site are most likely to be outdated. They are also presented in a fairly confusing way that may actually prevent people from installing New Relic. From the docs perspective, this is the default, because that's where our energy and attention are focused. It's also the place where we can easily make changes.

That being said, the current state of the manual installation docs is pretty wildly uneven and, in some cases, like the APM agent docs, bewilderingly complicated.

## Instant Observability [#io]

Instant Observability is catalog of things that can be monitored by New Relic and useful default dashboards and alerts.

For any quickstart, the **Install quickstart** button takes you to guided install, an add more data page, or a manual installation docs page.
