What are the elements of a good introduction? Engaging introductions seem to have at least these three features:

  * Present key information to define the topic
  * Capture the interest of the user
  * Tell the reader what to expect from the document

The first two items seem straightforward, but we often rely on repetitive and wooden phrases to tell readers what they can expect from the document. The way we do this raises questions. Who is doing the talking? Is it authoritative? Is it collaborative? Is this the best way to help users learn and solve their problems?

## Tips for more active introductions [#tips]

We have a number of pages on our site that have a heading followed by a `This document is about` introductory sentence. This sentence often restates the heading. Then, we often include a paragraph later that provides a better introduction. We recommend that you avoid using the `this document is about` stock phrase because it can be repetitive and often doesn't address the reader directly.

We’ll look at various alternatives to this type of construction throughout the document. Before you explore those alternatives, consider these ways to write stronger introductions:

  * Focus on the user right away. Instead of starting off talking about what the document is about, talk about what the user might want to know or do (think “Five questions”).
  * Ask yourself what information is missing or implied: You might have to define a term or a concept. For example, we have a docs page that focuses on using Gradle, but it never says what Gradle is. Or, in the Observability for Good page, we start off by referencing OfG, but we don’t say what it is.
  * Figure out what the real point of the page is and make sure to get it into the introduction. That information is usually contained shortly after the flat “This page is about this” introductory sentence. But you might have to really look at the page to find the emphasis.

To find new ways to reach your reader, explore some alternative approaches to introductions.

## Consider some different approaches [#what-about]

What is your document about? The way you answer this question affects your readers and your chance to engage them. If you use the same construction in all of your documents, they may be predictable, but they might also be repetitive to the point that users stop seeing those sentences.

The stock phrase tends to be a barrier to good detail, and it tends to repeat the information already provided in the page title. Often, by moving pertinent information up into the introduction, you can more specifically and interestingly let the reader know what the page is about.

Here’s a sample introduction that summarizes a problem and gets the readers’ attention:

```
Clogged drains account for 60 percent of calls to professional plumbers. You may be able to solve this problem yourself and avoid the expense.
```

What kind of third sentence could you add to this paragraph to tell readers what the rest of this document is about? The sections below have tables with various options for your third and final plumbing sentence. To see examples of revised introductions from our docs, jump down to the [Example lead-ins](#lead-ins) that avoid stock phrases and get to the heart of the page’s subject.


### Approach 1: Use second person [#second-person]

This option is one of the most engaging for readers because it weaves their needs with the subject of the page.

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Mood
      </th>
      <th>

      </th>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Indicative
      </td>
      <td>
        Second person singular
      </td>
      <td>
        You have three options to unclog your drain without a plumber.
      </td>
      <td>
        This directly identifies the user’s problem and suggests that the information they want is ahead.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3">
        Imperative
      </td>
      <td rowspan="3">
        2nd person singular
      </td>
      <td>
        To unclog your drain without a plumber, try these three options.
      </td>
      <td>
        This states the problem, which is  followed by a suggestion.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Consider these three options for unclogging your drain without a plumber.
      </td>
      <td>
        This reverses the example above by putting the problem second. The verb “consider” engages the reader, but this may have less power because of the delayed statement of the problem.

        The opening verb could be replaced with any number of verbs: “review,” “evaluate,” “try,” etc.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Read on to learn about three ways to unclog your drain without a plumber.
      </td>
      <td>
        Although this construction uses second person, the verb itself doesn’t address the reader’s concern and the problem comes second.
      </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


### Approach 2: Use third person [#third-person]

This is the tried and true option, but it can become robotic and can be less engaging to readers. A few pitfalls exist with this approach.


### Approach 3: Use first person [#first-person]

When you use the first person `we` in a procedural document, the `we` refers to you as the writer along with the reader. You are both going through the steps together.

<Callout variant="tip">
This is a different use of `we` from the more general usage where `we` can refer to New Relic. You can use `we` as a substitute for `New Relic` when it doesn’t refer to the writer and the reader together. For example, “NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features).”
</Callout>

First person is probably best used in the context of tutorials where a personal relationship is explicit. For example, if you have a blog or a course and you’re walking users through a procedure. At New Relic, we don’t often have this context, but we may have some cases where this fits.

If you have a context where first person is appropriate, avoid cases where first person sends the message that the company is secretly observing the user or their data. For example, you wouldn’t want to have a first person usage like this: “We see that your agent is out of date. Would you like to update it?”
