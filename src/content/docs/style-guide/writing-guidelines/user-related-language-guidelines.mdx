This doc will explain required styles and recommended phrasings for user-related terminology on the New Relic One user model.


## Note about user models 

Note that this style guide applies to the New Relic One user model, not the original user model. Even though both user models share certain terms (e.g., **Admin**), this is an entirely different user model with a very different structure, recommended phrasings, and style. To understand user model differences, see [Overview of user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). 

The original user model will be increasingly deprecated so we shouldn't need to talk much about that user model or update those docs. 


## Styles and formatting [#styles]

Here are some user-related styles and formats for user-related language for the New Relic One user model:


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
<th>Category</th>   
<th>Example use     
 </th>

<th>Styles and tips
</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
[User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) (basic user vs full user)
      </td>

      <td>
"If you’re a full user..."   </td>

      <td>
Lower case, no style.

Note that it can sometimes be awkward when "basic user" is in front of a noun. For example: "To learn about basic user capabilities..." can sound like you're talking about user capabilities that are basic. To avoid this, rephrase to be more clear and/or link to the [user type doc section](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) from "basic user" or "full user."
      </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
[Roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) 
      </td>

      <td>
"You must be in a group that has the [**Billing user** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#standard-roles)."
      </td>

      <td>
Sentence case, bold.

This phrasing is meant to cover all cases where a user is in a group that has that role, whether that group is a default group (**Admin** or **User**) or a custom group that has had that role assigned.

We recommend linking to the [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#standard-roles) doc, which lists and defines the roles, and also explains how these roles are related to the default groups (**Admin** and **User**). 

      </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
[Default groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-group)      </td>

      <td>
"When adding a user, add them to the [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups)."
 </td>

      <td>
Sentence case, bold.

We recommend linking to the [explanation of default groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups) for more context. 
      </td>

    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>


## General philosophy for user permissions/roles language [#user-language-philosophy]

Our general philosophy is summed up in these points:

* For most docs (with exception of API docs, explained below), we should only document [role-related requirements](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles). If there is a specific [standard role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) required to use a feature/functionality, explain that in a requirements section so that customers will understand what user role they need to use that feature. This approach means that our user-related restriction mentions should be fairly infrequent, as there are only a few features that are gated by a specific standard role. We don't document restrictions related to user type (basic vs full user) or default groups (more on that below). 
    * API docs: Because APIs are not as obvious and transparent as the product UI, we should document any requirements that SMEs think are relevant, which may also include user type. Attempt to list any API requirements in a single location, and not spread them throughout the docs. 
    * For more about role language guidelines, see [the table](#styles).
* We don't document restrictions related to user type (basic vs full): this is because things that are off limits to basic users in the product are also places they are given upsell notes. And because those limitations are so widespread, we would be documenting that everywhere. 
* We don't explain restrictions related to default user groups (**Admin** and **User**). This is because, while the group does impact what you can access, the actual mechanism causing the restriction is due to a standard role, not to the group. 

If you have questions about how user type, user group, and user roles relate, see the [User model docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#type-role-group).

## Original user model permissions [#original-model]

Sometimes it's necessary to explain how access works for users on both user models. This should be less and less required over time because customers will be converging on the new pricing plan and new user model, and we should attempt to avoid it unless completely necessary. But if this is deemed required, you can explain this using the following approach:

```
User role requirements:

• Users on the [original user model](link): the [**Data retention manager** role](link).
• Users on [New Relic One user model](link): the [**Billing user** role](link).
```
