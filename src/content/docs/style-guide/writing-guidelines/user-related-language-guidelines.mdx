This doc explains required styles and recommended phrasings for user-related terminology on the New Relic One user model.


## Note about user models 

This style guide applies to the New Relic One user model, not the original user model. Even though both user models share certain terms (such as **Admin**), this is an entirely different user model with a very different structure, recommended phrasings, and style. To understand user model differences, see [Overview of user model changes](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models). 

The original user model will be increasingly deprecated, so we shouldn't need to talk much about that user model or update those docs. 


## Styles and formatting [#styles]

Here are some user-related styles and formats for user-related language for the New Relic One user model:


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
<th>Category</th>   
<th>Example use     
 </th>

<th>Styles and tips
</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
[User type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) (basic user vs full user)
      </td>

      <td>
"If you’re a full user..."   </td>

      <td>
Lower case, no style.

Note that it can sometimes be awkward when "basic user" is in front of a noun. For example: "To learn about basic user capabilities..." can sound like you're talking about user capabilities that are basic. To avoid this, rephrase to be more clear and/or link to the [user type doc section](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-type) from "basic user" or "full user."
      </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
[Roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#standard-roles) 
      </td>

      <td>
"You must be in a group that has the [**Billing user** role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#standard-roles)."
      </td>

      <td>
Sentence case, bold.

This phrasing is meant to cover all cases where a user is in a group that has that role, whether that group is a default group (**Admin** or **User**) or a custom group that has had that role assigned.

We recommend linking to the [standard roles](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure#standard-roles) doc, which lists and defines the roles, and also explains how these roles are related to the default groups (**Admin** and **User**). 

      </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
[Default groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles#user-group)      </td>

      <td>
"When adding a user, add them to the [**Admin** group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups)."
 </td>

      <td>
Sentence case, bold.

We recommend linking to the [explanation of default groups](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#groups) for more context.

## General philosophy for user permissions/roles language [#user-language-philosophy]

First, it will help you to understand the relationship between groups, roles, and capabilities in the new New Relic One user model (sometimes referred to as v2 users). We recommend reading [this explanation of how these concepts relate](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#type-role-group). 

The following explanations about our permissions documentation philosophy applies for documenting our New Relic One user model, not our original user model.

### Don't document user type or group restrictions 

We don't document restrictions related to user type (basic vs. full user) or default groups. Some information about why that is: 

* **Basic vs. full users:** We don't document restrictions related to user type (basic vs. full). This is because things that are off limits to basic users in the product are also places they are given upsell notes. And because those limitations are so widespread, we would be documenting that everywhere. **API docs exception:** Because APIs are not as obvious and transparent as the product UI, we should document any requirements that SMEs think are relevant, which may include user type. Attempt to put any requirements for using an API in a single location, and not spread them throughout the docs.
* **Default user groups:** We don't explain restrictions related to default user groups (**Admin** and **User**). This is because, while the group does impact what you can access, the actual mechanism causing the restriction is due to a standard role, not to the group. 

If you have questions about how user type, user group, and user roles relate, see the [User model docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#type-role-group).

### Do document necessary role or capability requirements 

When necessary, we should document any roles or capabilities that gate access to a feature. A few notes on this: 

* Note that our [standard roles](com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles) are just aggregations of [capabilities](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#capabilities), and this means that a capability may be on several of our standard roles. In that case, you'd have to reference the capabilities. It is okay to err on general side when referencing these, as is shown in an example below. 
* Some standard roles (like **Billing user** and **Organization manager** and **Authentication domain manager**) have capabilities that aren't exposed in the UI to customers, so this means that in those cases we'd have to just reference the role and not a specific capability. 

Examples: 
* [Example of documenting roles in user management docs](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/tutorial-add-new-user-groups-roles-new-relic-one-user-model/#requirements)
* [Example of documenting capabilities in Pixie requirements](/docs/auto-telemetry-pixie/get-started-auto-telemetry-pixie/#before-you-begin).

### Document requirements for both original and new user model

If you are including requirements about New Relic One user model roles or capabilities, you may also need to include details about the original user model. Here's an example of how to do that. 

Permissions requirements differ depending on your user model:

* For users on the [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): the [**Data retention manager** role](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model/#roles).
* For users on the [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-models): the [**Billing user** role](com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/new-relic-one-user-model-understand-user-structure/#standard-roles).
