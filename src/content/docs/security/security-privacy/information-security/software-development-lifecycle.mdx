Software built at New Relic goes through these five phases.

## Requirements
Each project team is assigned a security engineer charged with ensuring the security of New Relic products. In the requirements building phase, the security engineer performs a risk assessment and then adds security requirements for the project. We add privacy and compliance experts to the project teams as needed.

## Design
During the design phase, the New Relic Security team collaborates with the stakeholders, engineering leaders, and architects to get a detailed shared understanding of the feature. Security engineers at New Relic contribute to the design process with stakeholders by creating a threat model documenting any acceptance criteria, features, or requirements to securely implement the feature. Using the threat model, the security engineer adds detailed specifications for the required controls to the project.

## Build
In the build phase, the engineering team implements the features in the project following secure coding standards at New Relic. Each product engineer receives secure coding training, which includes topics such as the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/), input sanitization, and using the secure frameworks and processes already in place at New Relic.

## Verification
Once feature complete, every pull request must be code reviewed by another engineer with write access to the repository. At the project level, teams may request a final review of the project before deploying. The security engineer verifies that the safeguards and controls discovered and documented in the risk assessment, requirements, and design phases have been addressed.

All New Relic code has passed static code and composition analysis to look for vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies. All files published by New Relic will include their calculated hash and a digital signature. New Relic is in the process of including hashes and signatures, so that anyone downloading files published by New Relic will be able to confirm their downloaded file has not been tampered with and is identical to the one published by New Relic.

## Deploy
Deployed code is monitored by stakeholders and product engineers in order to continue the iterative development process. The security team continues to evaluate the security of deployed code by performing regular scans, third-party penetration tests, and through the coordinated disclosure process via HackerOne.
