## HIPAA 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for personal health information held by covered entities and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information. Customers who want to use New Relic in compliance with US HIPAA can contact your account representative regarding a Business Associate Addendum (BAA).

HIPAA account enablement information can be found here at the [HIPAA Readiness page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/security/security-privacy/compliance/hipaa-readiness-new-relic/).
