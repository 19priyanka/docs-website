## Action items [#action]

To remediate this vulnerability in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers take the following action immediately:

Upgrade your Containerized Private Minion (CPM) [version 3.0.55](/docs/release-notes/synthetics-release-notes/containerized-private-minions-release-notes/containerized-private-minion-cpm-3055/). This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.15.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. 

This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. Customers that are using affected versions of the log4j framework (versions 2.10 to 2.14.1) directly in their applications will also need to either upgrade log4j to version 2.15.0 or use the workarounds published by Apache to remediate this issue for their application.

You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to [NR21-03](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-03) for more information.
