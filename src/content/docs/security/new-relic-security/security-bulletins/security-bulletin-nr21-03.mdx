## Summary

New Relic has released [Java agents 6.5.1](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/java-agent-651/) and [7.4.1](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/java-agent-741/) to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on 2021-12-09. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters.

A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on 2021-12-14. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations.

New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available.

## Action items [#action]

To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher).

If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time.  We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either [disable the Java agent logging](#disable), or [use the Apache workaround options](#apache-workaround).

### Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging [#disable]

You can set your Java agent logging level to `OFF` to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options:

* Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the `log_level` parameter).
* Define the `newrelic.config.log_level=OFF` system property.
* Set the `NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF` environment variable.

Then restart your application.

After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written.

**Note:** This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version.

### Option 2. Apache workaround options [#apache-workaround]

[Apache has published multiple workaround options](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html)for CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application.

**Note:** This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version.

If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html). This page provides remediation details for you to consider.

### Containerized private minions [#CPM]

You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to [NR21-04](/docs/security/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr21-04) for more information.
