title: The new externals
---
The new externals feature builds on New Relic legacy externals: It still shows you upstream and downstream transaction activity for a single service but now includes more information, such as errors and percentage change between metrics. Also, the quality of data in new externals (and transactions), remains unchanged when you enable distributed tracing. You get the best of both worlds: detailed views of transactions from externals along with end-to-end request details from distributed tracing.

With the the new externals, you can:

* Find sources of latency and errors
* Assess the impact of latency to upstream callers
* Review transaction-level performance
* Find links to traces

To use the new externals feature, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a free account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you're currently using the legacy externals, you can continue using it for now, but we encourage you to try out the new externals feature. You can simply switch to the new externals tab in the UI. To really see the benefits, you can also turn on distributed tracing.

## What do we mean by externals? [#what-externals-is]

In the New Relic UI, external services may be your own services you instrumented, or they may refer to services you simply call in the course of a transaction. The new externals feature tracks both types of calls.

The new externals feature starts you off with an initial map as you prepare to follow the journey of requests to and from your service. The service you select as the starting point appears at the center as a hexagon (graph vertex) with lines (graph edges) connecting it to the upstream and downstream services (graph vertices).

Your service may have multiple endpoints that call various endpoints in the upstream or downstream services. Each of these calls is a transaction, and the thickness of the lines represents the throughput from your service to the upstream or downstream services. 

## When would you use the new externals? [#when-to-use]

The new externals is a tool you can use by itself to tune or troubleshoot a specific service, or you can use it as a starting point for additional troubleshooting with distributed tracing or even infrastructure agents. 

### Relationship to other New Relic maps [#other-maps]

Although the new externals feature uses a map that looks similar to other maps in New Relic, the big difference is that it includes transaction details between services. Also, the scope of the new externals is on a single service and it's relationships with the upstream and downstream service. Our other mapping tools do not show transaction-level detail:

  * Trace maps: These maps in distributed tracing show the path of an entire request from end to end.
  * Automap: This mapping tool shows relationships between services, but it only shows information if there has been a change within the last three hours. Also, automap is dependent on the alert status for an entity, which means that you need to set up alerts for automap to be helpful.
  * Service maps: [HOW IS THIS FEATURE DIFFERENT FROM THE NEW EXTERNALS?]

### Example [#use-case]

One example of how you might use the new externals is to troubleshoot slow downstream services. Let's say you're a developer responsible for service A:

1. You get an alert that average response time has increased anomalously. 
2. You look at your service and see that time spent in calls to other services has increased around the time of the alert. 
3. You drill into the new external services and see that total time calling one service in particular, service B, increased just before the alert was fired. 
4. You see that service B is owned by another team, who you happen to know is in a timezone where itâ€™s nighttime right now, so you keep digging after you page that team.
5. You look at service B. It appears to be healthy overall, with no alerts firing and no significant increase in its overall response times. However, service B has very high throughput overall and many services call it, so perhaps the traffic from A differs in some way.
