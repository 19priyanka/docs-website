title: The new externals
---
The new externals feature builds on New Relic legacy externals and allows you to look closely at the activity for a single service. The power of the new externals is to provide transaction data similar to legacy externals but based on New Relic distributed tracing. 

With the the new externals, you can:

* Find sources of latency and errors
* Assess the impact of latency to upstream callers
* Review transaction-level performance
* Find traces that involve the transactions you're interested in

To use the new externals feature, you need a New Relic account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up [here](https://newrelic.com/signup) for a free account.

<Callout variant="important">
  To use the new externals feature, you need to enable distributed tracing. So, if you are currently relying on legacy externals and want to test new externals, the fidelity of your legacy transaction metrics would drop when you turn on distributed tracing. If you try the  new externals, you may find that transactions in the new externals may provide sufficient detail.

## Sampling [#sampling]

Legacy externals was driven by metric data that was generated from cross-application tracing. In contrast, the new externals is based on trace data and is driven by our distributed tracing feature. This means that what you see in the UI is sampled data. The UI shows this sampled subset of the requests that take place between your traget service and the upstream and downstream services.

The reason sampling is used is due to the high volume of data. Because of sampling, you may need to adjust the amount of sampling that takes place to allow more data to flow into the UI. 

## What do we mean by externals? [#what-externals-is]

In the New Relic UI, external services may be your own services you instrumented, or they may refer to services you simply call in the course of a transaction. The new externals feature tracks both types of calls.

The new externals feature starts you off with an initial map as you prepare to follow the journey of requests to and from your service. The service you select as the starting point appears at the center as a hexagon (graph vertex) with lines (graph edges) connecting it to the upstream and downstream services (graph vertices).

Your service may have multiple endpoints that call various endpoints in the upstream or downstream services. Each of these calls is a transaction, and the thickness of the lines represents the throughput from your service to the upstream or downstream services. 

## When would you use the new externals? [#when-to-use]

The new externals is a tool you can use by itself to tune or troubleshoot a specific service, or you can use it as a starting point for additional troubleshooting with distributed tracing or even infrastructure agents. 

### Relationship to other New Relic maps [#other-maps]

Although the new externals feature uses a map that looks similar to other maps in New Relic, the big difference is that it includes transaction details between services. Also, the scope of the new externals is on a single service and it's relationships with the upstream and downstream service. Our other mapping tools do not show transaction-level detail:

  * Trace maps: These maps in distributed tracing show the path of an entire request from end to end.
  * Automap: This mapping tool shows relationships between services, but it only shows information if there has been a change within the last three hours. Also, automap is dependent on the alert status for an entity, which means that you need to set up alerts for automap to be helpful.
  * Service maps: [HOW IS THIS FEATURE DIFFERENT FROM THE NEW EXTERNALS?]

### Example [#use-case]

One example of how you might use the new externals is to troubleshoot slow downstream services. Let's say you're a developer responsible for service A:

1. You get an alert that the average response time has increased anomalously. 
2. You look at your service and see that time spent in calls to other services has increased around the time of the alert. 
3. You drill into the new external services and see that the total time calling one service in particular, service B, increased just before the alert was fired. 
4. You select Service B on the map, and see the performance of individual transactions in Service A that call transactions in Service B. You notice that one particular transaction on Service A is slower than normal, and that it calls one transaction on Service B.

Then, you can use distributed tracing to drill into more detail:

1. Drill into distributed tracing and see in the trace that the calls in this transaction are doing something odd.
2. Jump to that transaction on service B and see that it got slow after a deploy
3. [ANYTHING ELSE?]
