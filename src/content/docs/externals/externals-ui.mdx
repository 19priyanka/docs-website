title: How to use the new externals UI
---

The UI for new externals is a great place to analyze a single service along with its upstream and downstream services. The UI starts you off with a map of your selected service, along with related graphs showing the top five results for response time, call count, and error count.

## How to find the new externals feature [#where-externals]

The new externals is available from the left navigation pane once you select a service in Explorer. Do one of the following:

   * New Relic Explorer: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > External services**.
   * APM: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services**.

## How to use the new externals map [#use-the-map]

The initial map shows your selected service as a hexagon (vertex) in the center with lines (edges) linking it to other hexagons (vertices) for upstream and downstream services. The map displays an aggregation of all of the distributed traces that were recorded that involve this service, as well as  all the different calls between transactions between the various endpoints.

The thickness of the lines represents the throughput for the service, and the darkness of the line is time consumed (throughput times duration).

Here is a typical map workflow:

1. Look for the thickest and darkest line on the map and follow it to its upstream or downstream service.
2. Click on the endpoint in the upstream or downstream service, which opens a new map of that transaction. 
[QUESTION: HOW CAN I GET A SCREENSHOT OF A SINGLE TRANSACTION?]
3. If you decide that a particular transaction is taking the most time, you can click **Traces** in the bottom pane of externals.
[QUESTION: WHERE CAN I GET A SCREENSHOT OF THIS?]
4. [QUESTION: WHAT ADDITION STEPS DO WE NEED HERE?


[QUESTION: WHAT OTHER ASPECTS OF THE UI DO WE NEED TO EXPLAIN? DO WE NEED TO COACH USERS ABOUT THE MEANING OF THE NUMBERS (RESPONSE TIME, CALL COUNT, ETC.)]
