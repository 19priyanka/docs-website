BETA

Our [Infrastructure monitoring integrations](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/introduction-infrastructure-integrations) include an integration for reporting your AWS Kinesis Data Analytics data to our products. Read on to learn more about how to activate the integration and what data it collects.

## Activate integration

To enable this integration follow standard procedures to [Connect AWS services to Infrastructure](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-integrations/getting-started/connect-aws-integrations-infrastructure).

## Configuration and polling

You can change the polling frequency and filter data using [configuration options](/docs/integrations/new-relic-integrations/getting-started/configure-polling-frequency-data-collection-cloud-integrations).

Default [polling](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-polling-intervals-infrastructure-integrations) information for the AWS Kinesis Data Analytics integration:

*   New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes
*   Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 1 minute

## Find and use data

To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to **[infrastructure.newrelic.com](https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/ "Link opens in a new window.") \> AWS** and select an integration.

Data is attached to the following [event type](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-insights#event-type):

## Metric data

This integration collects AWS Kinesis Data Analytics data for Application, ApplicationKpu, Task, TaskOperator, TaskParallelism and TaskOperatorParallelism.

### Kinesis Data Analytics Application data

Metric

Unit

Description

`bytesConsumedRate`

BytesPerSecond

The average number of bytes consumed per second for a topic.

`commitsFailed`

Count

The total number of offset commit failures to Kafka, if offset committing and checkpointing are enabled.

`commitsSucceeded`

Count

The total number of successful offset commits to Kafka, if offset committing and checkpointing are enabled.

`cpuUtilization`

Percent

Overall percentage of CPU utilization across task managers. For example, if there are five task managers, Kinesis Data Analytics publishes five samples of this metric per reporting interval.

The last watermark this application/operator/task/thread has emitted.

`downtime`

Milliseconds

For jobs currently in a failing/recovering situation, the time elapsed during this outage.

`fullRestarts`

Count

The total number of times this job has fully restarted since it was submitted. This metric does not measure fine-grained restarts.

`heapMemoryUtilization`

Percent

Overall heap memory utilization across task managers. For example, if there are five task managers, Kinesis Data Analytics publishes five samples of this metric per reporting interval.

Count

The number of records returned by a Lambda function that were marked with Ok status.

`inputProcessing.ProcessingFailedRecords`

Count

The number of records returned by a Lambda function that were marked with ProcessingFailed status.

`inputProcessing.Success`
