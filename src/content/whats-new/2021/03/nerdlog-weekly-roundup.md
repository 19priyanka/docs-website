## Using AI to find correlated failures

We’ve been working for the last few months to improve the [Incident Intelligence](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/applied-intelligence/incident-intelligence/get-started-incident-intelligence) system within [Applied Intelligence](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/feature-roundup-applied-intelligence/), an AIOps-assisted tool for showing how your alerts connect. The correlation preview shows how multiple events would be correlated in future incidents.

## Smart alert muting on New Relic

Muting lets you set criteria, including a time window, for muting alerts and notifications. You can filter by tags or other attributes, finding only those violations that shouldn’t trigger alerts. Alerting doesn’t mean disabling monitoring: while this tool will stamp incidents with `muted = true`, they’ll still be visible in Applied Intelligence.
