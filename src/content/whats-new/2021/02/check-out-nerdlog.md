Every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT (8 p.m. UTC) live on Twitch, you can:

* **Learn about the latest features from the people who built them:** Watch New Relic product managers and engineers play with the latest features and integrations to help you navigate New Relic like a pro.
* **Get some knowledge and a little inspiration:** Walk away with tons of resources, projects with step-by-step instructions, and all your questions answered.
* **Connect with other engineers:** Engage directly with New Relic product managers and engineers. Share your experiences with other New Relic users and have fun as you learn about observability.

If you miss any episodes, you can find the recordings [here](https://www.twitch.tv/new_relic/videos) and you can always come back to [What's new?](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new) to see anything you missed.
