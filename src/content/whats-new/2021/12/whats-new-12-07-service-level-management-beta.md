## Public beta for New Relic's service level management

We're excited to announce the public beta for our service level management!

New Relic Oneâ€™s new, simple interface for service level management (beta) makes it easy to understand how services and nodes are doing over time. When an SLI or an SLO target is not met (or is close to failing for the evaluation period), New Relic provides contextual data around deployments, infrastructure changes, anomalies, and issues that could be the cause. Now, your DevOps, IT, and SRE teams can identify problems anywhere in the stack and proactively resolve reliability concerns. Service level management is essential for you to make decisions about how to proceed when errors and incidents occur and will help influence how you prioritize future projects in your product roadmap.

You can learn more about this release and how you can implement service level management in [our docs](/docs/service-level-management/intro-slm).
