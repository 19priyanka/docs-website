Weâ€™ve released a few errors inbox features designed to help you efficiently prioritize and organize your error groups, and help you act quickly on any errors without having to context-switch.

These enhancements include: 
* **[Regression flags](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#regression-tag)  for faster detection and prioritization:** Error groups that were previously resolved are auto-unresolved if a new error instance that matches an error group fingerprint is detected. Regressed error groups are valuable to identify because they generally represent a higher ROI bug since they continue to occur 
* **[Bulk actions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox/#bulk-actions) to save time and declutter the inbox:** You can now update the status of multiple error groups (up to 2,000) all at once. 
* **[Email Notifications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/errors-inbox/errors-email-notifications) to foster contextual collaboration:** Email notifications and any status updates are now sent via New Relic to assigned users, with detailed error information in-line.
