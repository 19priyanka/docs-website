# Longer running queries allow you to analyze larger volumes of data

After the launch of [Data Plus](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2022/06/whats-new-6-1-data-plus-available) in June, we are continuing to support and help your teams scale their observability practices. Today, Data Plus customers now can utilize longer running queries (up to 10x the the previous maximum duration) to analyze larger data volumes.  Data Plus customers get a max query duration of up to 10 minutes via asynchronous queries and up to 2 minutes via regular NRQL queries compared to 60 seconds for the existing data option. Learn how to run [asynchronous queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial/) via our [NerdGraph] (https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/) API.

In addition to more powerful and 10x maximum duration longer running queries, Data Plus also includes:

* Up to 90 days of data retention 
* FedRAMP and HIPAA compliance (Pro and Enterprise customers only) 
* Logs obfuscation
* Cloud provider choice (coming soon)
* Enhanced streaming and historical data export (coming soon) 
* Vulnerability management (coming soon)
