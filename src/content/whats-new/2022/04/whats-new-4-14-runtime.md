Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively test flows through your application so you can identify and resolve performance issues quickly, before they negatively impact your end usersâ€™ experience. Today, we announce the release of next-generation runtime for synthetic monitoring, which includes updated functionalities to easily test user flows in your production environment and catch potential issues.

Our next-generation runtime supports the latest version of Chrome (version 100) and unlocks the testing of modern applications requiring newer Chrome versions; the new synthetics runtime also makes browser version updates easier and more frequent. Additional capabilities include use of the got Node request module, async / await support, and a custom timing library, allowing you to explore new synthetic monitoring use cases by reducing required monitor complexity. 

With the next-generation runtime, you can spin up monitors with fewer lines of code, maintain browser compatibility over time, and more effectively detect and fix performance issues before they affect end-users.
