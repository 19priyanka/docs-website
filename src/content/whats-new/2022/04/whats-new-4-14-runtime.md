## Front matter tips (remove this section before publishing)

The front matter is the group of lines at the top of the post before your content begins. The front matter is sandwiched between lines containing three dashes. Here's what you need to know about each front matter line:

* title (required): The title field is how your readers will browse through `What's new` and find what interests them. Make your titles as short as possible and include the most relevant product and feature names. The more specific you get, the more likely people will be to read the post.As with other pages on the site, use sentence case for titles (Only one capital letter at the beginning of the title). 
* summary (required): A brief description of the feature that appears directly under the title in the left sidebar and at the top of the post. Make sure your summary is a single sentence and isn't more than about 10-20 words.
* releaseDate (required): The date a feature is released. `What's new` posts are organized chronologically. This controls where a post will show on the list. If you have two or more posts on the same date, use the time field to control the post order.
* learnMoreLink (optional): Learn more links are used to highlight blog posts or other marketing material that provides more information about the feature. Remove this if you are not using it!
* getStartedLink (optional): This is a link to to documents that explain how to set up the feature. Remove this if you are not using it!
* isFeatured: For tier one launches, you can insert `isFeatured: true` in the front matter to pin your post to the top of the product UI. The technical writers will remove this flag from the previously featured post–unless you need multiple pinned posts.

Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively test flows through your application so you can identify and resolve performance issues quickly, before they negatively impact your end users’ experience. Today, we announce the release of next-generation runtime for synthetic monitoring, which includes updated functionalities to easily test user flows in your production environment and catch potential issues.

Our next-generation runtime supports the latest version of Chrome (version 100) and unlocks the testing of modern applications requiring newer Chrome versions; the new synthetics runtime also makes browser version updates easier and more frequent. Additional capabilities include use of the got Node request module, async / await support, and a custom timing library, allowing you to explore new synthetic monitoring use cases by reducing required monitor complexity. 

With the next-generation runtime, you can spin up monitors with fewer lines of code, maintain browser compatibility over time, and more effectively detect and fix performance issues before they affect end-users.
