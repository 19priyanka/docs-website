## Changes to the usage section in your account administration area

We’re always looking for ways to improve accuracy of the data for our customers. As of today, the usage section will no longer display monthly estimated costs. The usage section will continue to display month-to-date usage, including GB ingest and provisioned users. We are making this change to avoid confusion in scenarios where estimated costs differ from actual month-to-date costs due to various scenarios. The monthly invoice provides an accurate single-source of truth of monthly costs.

To see user counts and gigabytes ingested within the current month, you can continue to view them in your [usage section](https://one.newrelic.com/usage-and-cost).

## Where can you view your costs?
If you did not purchase New Relic through a third party and you are authorized to manage billing, you can access your most recent invoices from your [billing page](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/billing-ui/). This is your source of truth for billing information.

Note that you can still calculate and view your estimated month-to-date costs via NRQL queries. See our [docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#estimated-cost-removal).
