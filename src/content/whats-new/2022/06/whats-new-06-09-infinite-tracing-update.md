There are some new enhancements and benefits of [New Relic Infinite Tracing](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing) that are now available:

**[EU & APAC Availability:](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer#create-for-mlb)** Access to New Relic Infinite Tracing is now available to all customers in the European Union and Asia-Pacific regions. Customers can send all their traces to a regional service (trace observer) to decide what data to send to New Relic. This ensures customers have a low egress cost for tail-based sampling while also addressing regional compliance requirements.

**[Browser, Mobile, and Serverless Support:](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer#initial-config)** View traces from the entire software stack with support for browser, mobile, and AWS Lambda. Front-end developers and cloud architects can now specify the types of browser, mobile, or serverless traces they care about and never miss a trace again.
