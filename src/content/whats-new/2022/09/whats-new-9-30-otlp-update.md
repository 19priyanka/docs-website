Today, New Relic is excited to announce support for OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) version [0.18.0](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/releases/tag/v0.18.0). A number of enhancements have been introduced to the protocol since New Relic announced general availability for OTLP a year ago on version 0.10.0. Importantly, the logs data model was declared stable in version 0.18.0. The data model for the other signals, traces and metrics, were decleared stable in prior releases. At this time, JSON encoding has not been declared stable. Another exciting enhancement available in version 0.18.0 is the addition of exponential histograms. Exponential histograms provide better representation for high density distributions for measurements like response time with little to no configuration required. Learn more by reading our recent blog post on [OpenTelemetry exponential histograms](https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/opentelemetry-histograms). Finally, a small number of fields have been added, changed, or removed from the protocol in this version. For the cases where fields were changed or removed, we've taken measures to provide some backward compatibility despite breaking changes.
