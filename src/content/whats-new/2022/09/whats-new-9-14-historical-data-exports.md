#  Historical data export allows you to secure, store, share and analyze data to your external tools

Today, [Data Plus](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new/2022/06/whats-new-6-1-data-plus-available) customers now can export their New Relic historical data to outside of New Relic. This provides flexibility for deeper data exploration across related entities, events, and anomalies within their stack, along with the ability to upload results to external analytics tools. The historical data is exported by NRQL querying in NerdGraph that returns up 200 million data points. The resulting historical data is provided as a downloadable link to a JSON file. 

In addition Data Plus also includes:

* Up to 90 days of data retention 
* FedRAMP authorized
* HIPAA compliance with HITRUST certification (Pro and Enterprise customers only) 
* Logs obfuscation
* Streaming data export (October 2022)
* Vulnerability management (Q4 2022)
* Cloud provider choice (Q1 2023)
