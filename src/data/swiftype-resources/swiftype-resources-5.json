      "body": "Syntax public interface ITransaction Copy Provides access to transaction-specific methods in the New Relic API. Description Provides access to transaction-specific methods in the New Relic .NET agent API. To obtain a reference to ITransaction, use the current transaction method available on IAgent. This section contains descriptions and parameters of three ITransaction methods: Name Description AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts incoming trace context headers from another service. InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Adds trace context headers to an outgoing request. AcceptDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Accepts an incoming distributed trace payload from another service. CreateDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Creates a distributed trace payload for inclusion in an outgoing request. AddCustomAttribute Add contextual information from your application to the current transaction in form of attributes. CurrentSpan Provides access to the currently executing span, which provides access to span-specific methods in the New Relic API. AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders ITransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by InsertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated AcceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. Syntax void AcceptDistributedHeaders(carrier, getter, transportType) Copy Parameters Name Description carrier < T> Required. Source of incoming Trace Context headers. getter Func < T, string, IEnumerable < string>> Required. Caller-defined function to extract header data from the carrier. transportType TransportType enum Required. Describes the transport of the incoming payload (for example TransportType.HTTP). Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders will be ignored if InsertDistributedTraceHeaders or AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders has already been called for this transaction. Example HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; currentTransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(httpContext, Getter, TransportType.HTTP); IEnumerable<string> Getter(HttpContext carrier, string key) { string value = carrier.Request.Headers[key]; return value == null ? null : new string[] { value }; } Copy InsertDistributedTraceHeaders ITransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the carrier object that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with <distributedTracing excludeNewrelicHeader=\"true\" /> in the config. This method replaces the deprecated CreateDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Syntax void InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(carrier, setter) Copy Parameters Name Description carrier < T> Required. Container where Trace Context headers are inserted.. setter Action < T, string, string> Required. Caller-defined Action to insert header data into the carrier. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. Example HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; var setter = new Action<HttpWebRequest, string, string>((carrier, key, value) => { carrier.Headers?.Set(key, value); }); currentTransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(requestMessage, setter); Copy AcceptDistributedTracePayload Caution This API is not available in the .NET agent v9.0 or higher. Please use AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders instead. Accepts an incoming distributed trace payload from an upstream service. Calling this method links the transaction from the upstream service to this transaction. Syntax void AcceptDistributedPayload(payload, transportType) Copy Parameters Name Description payload string Required. A string representation of the incoming distributed trace payload. transportType TransportType enum Recommended. Describes the transport of the incoming payload (for example, http). Default TransportType.Unknown. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. The payload can be a Base64-encoded or plain text string. AcceptDistributedTracePayload will be ignored if CreateDistributedTracePayload has already been called for this transaction. Example //Obtain the information from the request object from the upstream caller. //The method by which this information is obtain is specific to the transport //type being used. For example, in an HttpRequest, this information is //contained in the header.KeyValuePair<string, string> metadata = GetMetaDataFromRequest(\"requestPayload\"); IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AcceptDistributedTracePayload(metadata.Value, TransportType.Queue); Copy CreateDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Caution This API is not available in the .NET agent v9.0 or higher. Please use InsertDistributedTraceHeaders instead. Creates a distributed trace payload for inclusion in an outgoing request to a downstream system. Syntax IDistributedTracePayload CreateDistributedTracePayload() Copy Returns An object that implements IDistributedTracePayload which provides access to the distributed trace payload that was created. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. CreateDistributedTracePayload will be ignored if AcceptDistributedTracePayload has already been called for this transaction. Example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; IDistributedTracePayload payload = transaction.CreateDistributedTracePayload(); Copy AddCustomAttribute Adds contextual information about your application to the current transaction in the form of attributes. This method requires .NET agent version and .NET agent API version 8.24.244.0 or higher. It replaced the deprecated AddCustomParameter. Syntax ITransaction AddCustomAttribute(string key, object value) Copy Parameters Parameter Description key string Identifies the information being reported. Also known as the name. Empty keys are not supported. Keys are limited to 255-bytes. Attributes with keys larger than 255-bytes will be ignored. value object The value being reported. Returns A reference to the current transaction. Usage considerations For details about supported data types, see the Custom Attributes Guide. Example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AddCustomAttribute(\"customerName\",\"Bob Smith\") .AddCustomAttribute(\"currentAge\",31) .AddCustomAttribute(\"birthday\", new DateTime(2000, 02, 14)) .AddCustomAttribute(\"waitTime\", TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(93842)); Copy CurrentSpan Provides access to the currently executing span, making span-specific methods available within the New Relic API. Example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; ISpan currentSpan = transaction.CurrentSpan; Copy Examples See Parameters section.",

Solution The absence of data may occur for several reasons. Common causes for missing data: See the basic troubleshooting solutions. Other situations: If the basic solutions do not solve the problem, the lack of data may be more intrinsic to your system. For more information, see the advanced troubleshooting solutions. Microsoft Azure users: See the Azure troubleshooting solutions. No browser data appears: See the troubleshooting tips when using the browser agent. Basic solutions To troubleshoot the most common reasons for missing data, try these solutions as applicable. Basic solutions Comments Check app and framework for compatibility with agent .NET Framework compatibility and requirements or .NET Core compatibility and requirements Configure for short-lived .NET process If you have a short-lived (below 60 seconds) process, it may not report data. For more information, see Monitor short-lived processes. .NET Core: Check Kestrel requirements. Make sure you are using a Kestrel app/web server supported by New Relic. Otherwise, you may need to ensure your .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. .NET Core: Check environment variables. Make sure you have configured all the required environment variables, then restart the agent. .NET Framework: Restart IIS. If your app is not receiving traffic, no data will be reported to New Relic. To restart IIS: From a command line, run IISRESET. Verify that traffic is being sent to your application. Run New Relic Diagnostics. To try to automatically identify the issue, use New Relic Diagnostics. Check for profiler conflicts. If you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures to resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts. Review log files. If log files exist, open them and review for errors. Advanced solutions To remedy more complex issues when no data appears, try these solutions as applicable: Advanced solutions Comments .NET Framework: Check Registry permissions. Check for a registry key permissions error. .NET Framework: Run Windows Event Viewer. If applicable: Run the Windows Event Viewer, and look for application events from the New Relic .NET Profiler. Search for messages whose source is the New Relic .NET Profiler or New Relic .NET agent. If there are no New Relic event messages, look for messages from the .NET Runtime. For more information, see No data or event log: CoCreate errors. Get debug logs. If your logs did not show errors, increase the logging level temporarily to collect debug logs. Check proxy settings.

Microsoft Azure users: See the Azure troubleshooting solutions. No browser data appears: See the troubleshooting tips when using the browser agent. Basic solutions To troubleshoot the most common reasons for missing data, try these solutions as applicable. Basic solutions Comments Check app and framework for compatibility with agent .NET Framework compatibility and requirements or .NET Core compatibility and requirements Configure for short-lived .NET process If you have a short-lived (below 60 seconds) process, it may not report data. For more information, see Monitor short-lived processes. .NET Core: Check Kestrel requirements. Make sure you are using a Kestrel app/web server supported by New Relic. Otherwise, you may need to ensure your .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. .NET Core: Check environment variables. Make sure you have configured all the required environment variables, then restart the agent. .NET Framework: Restart IIS. If your app is not receiving traffic, no data will be reported to New Relic. To restart IIS: From a command line, run IISRESET. Verify that traffic is being sent to your application. Run New Relic Diagnostics. To try to automatically identify the issue, use New Relic Diagnostics. Check for profiler conflicts. If you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), follow the troubleshooting procedures to resolve .NET and SCOM conflicts. Review log files. If log files exist, open them and review for errors. Advanced solutions To remedy more complex issues when no data appears, try these solutions as applicable: Advanced solutions Comments .NET Framework: Check Registry permissions. Check for a registry key permissions error. .NET Framework: Run Windows Event Viewer. If applicable: Run the Windows Event Viewer, and look for application events from the New Relic .NET Profiler. Search for messages whose source is the New Relic .NET Profiler or New Relic .NET agent. If there are no New Relic event messages, look for messages from the .NET Runtime. For more information, see No data or event log: CoCreate errors. Get debug logs. If your logs did not show errors, increase the logging level temporarily to collect debug logs. Check proxy settings.

Description Provides access to transaction-specific methods in the New Relic .NET agent API. To obtain a reference to ITransaction, use the current transaction method available on IAgent. This section contains descriptions and parameters of three ITransaction methods: Name Description AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts incoming trace context headers from another service. InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Adds trace context headers to an outgoing request. AcceptDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Accepts an incoming distributed trace payload from another service. CreateDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Creates a distributed trace payload for inclusion in an outgoing request. AddCustomAttribute Add contextual information from your application to the current transaction in form of attributes. CurrentSpan Provides access to the currently executing span, which provides access to span-specific methods in the New Relic API. AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders ITransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by InsertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated AcceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. Syntax void AcceptDistributedHeaders(carrier, getter, transportType) Copy Parameters Name Description carrier < T> Required. Source of incoming Trace Context headers. getter Func < T, string, IEnumerable < string>> Required. Caller-defined function to extract header data from the carrier. transportType TransportType enum Required. Describes the transport of the incoming payload (for example TransportType.HTTP).

It modifies the carrier object that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with <distributedTracing excludeNewrelicHeader=\"true\" /> in the config. This method replaces the deprecated CreateDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads.

Please use AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders instead. Accepts an incoming distributed trace payload from an upstream service. Calling this method links the transaction from the upstream service to this transaction. Syntax void AcceptDistributedPayload(payload, transportType) Copy Parameters Name Description payload string Required. A string representation of the incoming distributed trace payload. transportType TransportType enum Recommended. Describes the transport of the incoming payload (for example, http). Default TransportType.Unknown. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. The payload can be a Base64-encoded or plain text string.

Description Provides access to transaction-specific methods in the New Relic .NET agent API. To obtain a reference to ITransaction, use the current transaction method available on IAgent. This section contains descriptions and parameters of three ITransaction methods: Name Description AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders Accepts incoming trace context headers from another service. InsertDistributedTraceHeaders Adds trace context headers to an outgoing request. AcceptDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Accepts an incoming distributed trace payload from another service. CreateDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Creates a distributed trace payload for inclusion in an outgoing request. AddCustomAttribute Add contextual information from your application to the current transaction in form of attributes. CurrentSpan Provides access to the currently executing span, which provides access to span-specific methods in the New Relic API. AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders ITransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by InsertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated AcceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. Syntax void AcceptDistributedHeaders(carrier, getter, transportType) Copy Parameters Name Description carrier < T> Required. Source of incoming Trace Context headers. getter Func < T, string, IEnumerable < string>> Required. Caller-defined function to extract header data from the carrier. transportType TransportType enum Required. Describes the transport of the incoming payload (for example TransportType.HTTP). Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders will be ignored if InsertDistributedTraceHeaders or AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders has already been called for this transaction. Example HttpContext httpContext = HttpContext.Current; IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; currentTransaction.AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders(httpContext, Getter, TransportType.HTTP); IEnumerable<string> Getter(HttpContext carrier, string key) { string value = carrier.Request.Headers[key]; return value == null ? null : new string[] { value }; } Copy InsertDistributedTraceHeaders ITransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the carrier object that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with <distributedTracing excludeNewrelicHeader=\"true\" /> in the config. This method replaces the deprecated CreateDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Syntax void InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(carrier, setter) Copy Parameters Name Description carrier < T> Required. Container where Trace Context headers are inserted.. setter Action < T, string, string> Required. Caller-defined Action to insert header data into the carrier. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. Example HttpWebRequest requestMessage = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(\"https://remote-address\"); IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction currentTransaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; var setter = new Action<HttpWebRequest, string, string>((carrier, key, value) => { carrier.Headers?.Set(key, value); }); currentTransaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(requestMessage, setter); Copy AcceptDistributedTracePayload Caution This API is not available in the .NET agent v9.0 or higher. Please use AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders instead. Accepts an incoming distributed trace payload from an upstream service. Calling this method links the transaction from the upstream service to this transaction. Syntax void AcceptDistributedPayload(payload, transportType) Copy Parameters Name Description payload string Required. A string representation of the incoming distributed trace payload. transportType TransportType enum Recommended. Describes the transport of the incoming payload (for example, http). Default TransportType.Unknown. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. The payload can be a Base64-encoded or plain text string. AcceptDistributedTracePayload will be ignored if CreateDistributedTracePayload has already been called for this transaction. Example //Obtain the information from the request object from the upstream caller. //The method by which this information is obtain is specific to the transport //type being used. For example, in an HttpRequest, this information is //contained in the header.KeyValuePair<string, string> metadata = GetMetaDataFromRequest(\"requestPayload\"); IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; transaction.AcceptDistributedTracePayload(metadata.Value, TransportType.Queue); Copy CreateDistributedTracePayload (obsolete) Caution This API is not available in the .NET agent v9.0 or higher. Please use InsertDistributedTraceHeaders instead. Creates a distributed trace payload for inclusion in an outgoing request to a downstream system. Syntax IDistributedTracePayload CreateDistributedTracePayload() Copy Returns An object that implements IDistributedTracePayload which provides access to the distributed trace payload that was created. Usage considerations Distributed tracing must be enabled. CreateDistributedTracePayload will be ignored if AcceptDistributedTracePayload has already been called for this transaction. Example IAgent agent = NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetAgent(); ITransaction transaction = agent.CurrentTransaction; IDistributedTracePayload payload = transaction.CreateDistributedTracePayload(); Copy AddCustomAttribute Adds contextual information about your application to the current transaction in the form of attributes.

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end([callback]) transactionHandle.end([callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. Option name Type Attributes Default Description collectPendingData boolean Optional false Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout number Optional 0 The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. waitForIdle boolean Optional false If true, the agent will not shut down until there are no active transactions. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 10000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Either way, you need a New Relic account if you don't already have one. (It's free, forever!) Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent API allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. You can use this API to: Create custom transaction parameters Report custom errors and metrics You can also use the API for custom instrumentation. For supported frameworks, the agent instruments most activity automatically. Custom instrumentation lets you extend that monitoring to frameworks without default instrumentation. Other resources: The Node.js agent API documentation on GitHub has more detail and practical tutorials. You can also adjust the Node.js agent's default behavior with configuration settings. To see all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Requirements To use the Node.js agent API, make sure you have the latest Node.js agent release. In addition, see: Node.js agent API requirements Getting started procedures on GitHub Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Start timing a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See newrelic.startWebTransaction(). Stop timing a method after its work is completed Use either of these options: Return a promise from the callback handed to newrelic.startWebTransaction. Call end on a handle returned from newrelic.getTransaction. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction using any of these options: See Rules for ignoring requests. Call ignore() on a handle returned from newrelic.getTransaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use this method when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See newrelic.startSegment(). For more information about timing, see the instrumentation tutorial on GitHub. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in New Relic, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them . Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in New Relic: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See newrelic.setTransactionName and rules.name. Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. (Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Node.js agent.) See newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). Create a new transaction for background work See newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Create a new web transaction Use newrelic.startWebTransaction(). Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Rules for naming and ignoring requests, including the ignoring rules example. Record other performance data, such as timing or computer resource data Use the custom metrics API. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use these API calls to annotate your logs: newrelic.getTraceMetadata newrelic.getLinkingMetadata For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks and supported Node.js versions, New Relic's Node.js agent usually correctly instruments async work. However, if your app uses another framework, or if the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly track async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting See newrelic.startSegment. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting See newrelic.startSegment. Trace a transaction that got lost See newrelic.startSegment. You can also create your own custom instrumentation for libraries that are losing your transactions. Trace a lost transaction state A common issue is the loss of transaction state while using uninstrumented libraries. For more information, see the transaction preservation tutorial on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services Once the request naming API loads, New Relic's Node.js agent can automatically identify external service calls. You can also use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Use any of these as appropriate: Custom instrumentation API Message queues Also see the tutorials on GitHub for datastore shims and message shims. Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See newrelic.noticeError(). Send custom event and metric data from your app New Relic includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic Create a custom event. See newrelic.recordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them Add custom attributes if needed. (Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Node.js agent.) See newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See newrelic.recordMetric() and newrelic.incrementMetric(). To view the data, use the data explorer. Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add browser apps to New Relic. You can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Extend custom instrumentation The newrelic.instrument() provides additional flexibility for custom instrumentation. For more information, including tutorials and examples, see the shims documentation on GitHub.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Either way, you need a New Relic account if you don't already have one. (It's free, forever!) Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent API allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. You can use this API to: Create custom transaction parameters Report custom errors and metrics You can also use the API for custom instrumentation. For supported frameworks, the agent instruments most activity automatically. Custom instrumentation lets you extend that monitoring to frameworks without default instrumentation. Other resources: The Node.js agent API documentation on GitHub has more detail and practical tutorials. You can also adjust the Node.js agent's default behavior with configuration settings. To see all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Requirements To use the Node.js agent API, make sure you have the latest Node.js agent release. In addition, see: Node.js agent API requirements Getting started procedures on GitHub Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Start timing a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See newrelic.startWebTransaction(). Stop timing a method after its work is completed Use either of these options: Return a promise from the callback handed to newrelic.startWebTransaction. Call end on a handle returned from newrelic.getTransaction. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction using any of these options: See Rules for ignoring requests. Call ignore() on a handle returned from newrelic.getTransaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use this method when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See newrelic.startSegment(). For more information about timing, see the instrumentation tutorial on GitHub. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in New Relic, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them . Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in New Relic: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See newrelic.setTransactionName and rules.name. Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. (Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Node.js agent.) See newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). Create a new transaction for background work See newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Create a new web transaction Use newrelic.startWebTransaction(). Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Rules for naming and ignoring requests, including the ignoring rules example. Record other performance data, such as timing or computer resource data Use the custom metrics API. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use these API calls to annotate your logs: newrelic.getTraceMetadata newrelic.getLinkingMetadata For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks and supported Node.js versions, New Relic's Node.js agent usually correctly instruments async work. However, if your app uses another framework, or if the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly track async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting See newrelic.startSegment. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting See newrelic.startSegment. Trace a transaction that got lost See newrelic.startSegment. You can also create your own custom instrumentation for libraries that are losing your transactions. Trace a lost transaction state A common issue is the loss of transaction state while using uninstrumented libraries. For more information, see the transaction preservation tutorial on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services Once the request naming API loads, New Relic's Node.js agent can automatically identify external service calls. You can also use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Use any of these as appropriate: Custom instrumentation API Message queues Also see the tutorials on GitHub for datastore shims and message shims. Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See newrelic.noticeError(). Send custom event and metric data from your app New Relic includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic Create a custom event. See newrelic.recordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them Add custom attributes if needed. (Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Node.js agent.) See newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See newrelic.recordMetric() and newrelic.incrementMetric(). To view the data, use the data explorer. Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add browser apps to New Relic. You can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Extend custom instrumentation The newrelic.instrument() provides additional flexibility for custom instrumentation. For more information, including tutorials and examples, see the shims documentation on GitHub.",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end([callback]) transactionHandle.end([callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. Option name Type Attributes Default Description collectPendingData boolean Optional false Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout number Optional 0 The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. waitForIdle boolean Optional false If true, the agent will not shut down until there are no active transactions. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 10000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With custom instrumentation, you can instrument web sockets, background jobs, and unsupported databases. Custom instrumentation can also target specific sections of your code for deeper insight. Custom instrumentation is available in versions 1.10.0 or higher of the Node.js agent. To take advantage of the latest Node.js agent features, upgrade your agent. Instrumenting web transactions To instrument web transactions, such as websocket requests, create a custom transaction. Creating a custom transaction gives you the same type of visibility into that custom transaction that you would get from a transaction that the agent automatically instruments. Wrap the handler you want to instrument with createWebTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. Example: Instrument two transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message example is asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function (data) { socket.emit('pong') nr.endTransaction() })) socket.on('new-message', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function (data) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') nr.endTransaction() }) })) }) Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Instrumenting background transactions You can also use custom transactions to instrument background tasks, such as periodic jobs within your app or work that continues after a request completes. To instrument background tasks, wrap the handler you want to instrument with createBackgroundTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() setInterval(nr.createBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function () { var newValue = someDataGenerator() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { nr.endTransaction() // End the transaction once redis is done }) }), 30000) // Every 30s Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Expanding instrumentation within transactions You can also use custom instrumentation to provide more visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or to gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument callbacks, wrap the callback with createTracer(). If you want to instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, you need to wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with createTracer(). Tip You must place these examples inside an already instrumented transaction. The transaction can be automatically instrumented, or via a custom transaction. Example: Instrument a callback This examples wraps a single callback: // Wrap the callback in a segment db.createObject(nr.createTracer('db:createObject', function (err, result) { // Some error handler that will end the response for us if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() })) Copy Example: Instrument an async function This example wraps both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, we would not get any data from client.query. This allows createTracer() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. pg.connect(config.db_string, nr.createTracer('pg:connect', function (err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count', nr.createTracer('pg:query', function (err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') })) })) Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Node.js agent collects key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine (V8). These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics. What you need New Relic requires an additional native module to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with process.cpuUsage(). The native module can be used with: New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher NPM v2.0.0 or higher To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the node-gyp package procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include: Platform Prerequisites Unix/Linux Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC) macOS Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode Windows Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the installation troubleshooting procedures. Install the native module As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically. During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary. It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module. Do this by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD environment variable to true before installation with either NPM or Yarn. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true Copy npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy Alternatively, use the --no-download flag which works with NPM. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --no-download Copy If the build fails with NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true or the --no-download flag set, the optional native module will not be installed. If both environment variables are set, NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD will override NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD. If you're using an older version, upgrade to the latest agent version, or install the native module manually: Ensure a supported version of Node.js is installed. Recommendation: Use the latest LTS version. Do not use versions lower than the minimum supported version for the @newrelic/native-metrics module (v4 or higher). To get all currently available metrics, ensure you are running the newrelic module for agent 1.37.0 or higher. Windows users: Run the following command: npm install --global windows-build-tools Copy If this step doesn't work, follow Option 2 in the node-gyp module on GitHub for manual installation instructions. To install the native metrics module, use either of these methods: Run the npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --save command. OR Add the module to your app's package.json file. Restart your app. The Node.js agent automatically detects if the native metrics module is installed and starts using it. If you'd like to avoid installation of the native module completely, you can use the following NPM or Yarn arguments. npm install newrelic --no-optional Copy yarn add newrelic --ignore-optional Copy Pre-built binaries To skip the build step and only attempt to download a pre-built binary, and to avoid seeing build errors in the console, set the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD environment variable to true before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD=true Copy If working behind a firewall, you can cache pre-built binaries by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST and NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH environment variables before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://your-internal-cache/ Copy export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH=path/to/download/folder/ Copy Once you've set environment variables, installation can then proceed. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy View Node.js VM data To view curated charts with Node.js VM data, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. For more information, see the Node.js VMs statistics page. The data is also available in the data explorer: To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and at the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. Measurement details Tip Not all data can be collected across all Node versions. In general, you will get the most complete data if you are on the most recent LTS version of Node. Time in garbage collection Available on: Node.js agent v1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher New Relic Node.js @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher The amount of time spent in garbage collection (all types used by V8) by your Node process. Time is measured both as a cumulative metric, as GC/System/Pauses, and bucketed by garbage collection type as GC/<type>. Possible garbage collection types include: GC type Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node v6 or higher. Memory Available on: Node.js agent v1.36.0 or higher Node v4 or higher The New Relic Node.js agent collects the following metrics related to memory usage: Metric Description Memory/Physical The total physical memory (in MB) used by the Node process. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().rss Node API. Memory/Heap/Max The total heap (in MB) allocated by V8 for storing Javascript objects. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapTotal Node API. Memory/Heap/Used The amount of V8 heap (in MB) currently used by the app. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapUsed Node API. Memory/Heap/Free The amount of V8 memory (in MB) that is allocated but not used. This is a derived metric (heapTotal - heapUsed). Memory/NonHeap/Used The amount of memory other than V8 heap (in MB). This is a derived metric (rss - heapTotal). This metric is useful for finding memory leaks outside of V8 heap; for example, with buffers or streams. CPU Available on: Node >= v6.1.0, Agent v1.34.0 or higher Node v4 - v6.0.0, Agent v1.35.2 with @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher CPU metrics are collected on Node v6.1.0 or higher using the process.cpuUsage() Node API. For older versions of Node, the additional native module must be installed. The agent collects the following metrics related to CPU: Metric Description CPU/User Time The time spent by CPU executing the user code. It is recorded in seconds. CPU/User/Utilization The time spent executing the user code (CPU/User Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by the number of cores. CPU/System Time The time spent by CPU in the system kernel in relation to the Node process. CPU/System/Utilization The time spent in the system kernel (CPU/System Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by number of cores. Event Loop Available on: Node.js agent v1.37.0 or higher @newrelic/native-metrics v2.1.0 or higher Node v4 or higher Performance metrics for the Node event loop. Collection of event loop metrics requires installation of an additional native module. The agent collects the following event loop metrics: Metric Description Nodejs/EventLoop/CPU/Usage Copy The total CPU time spent actively executing in each event loop tick. This includes executing your application's callbacks, but also the runtime itself. Reported in units of seconds. An abnormally long event loop tick indicates unbroken synchronous execution that may be a target for optimization; for example, recursive process.nextTick calls).",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With custom instrumentation, you can instrument web sockets, background jobs, and unsupported databases. Custom instrumentation can also target specific sections of your code for deeper insight. Custom instrumentation is available in versions 1.10.0 or higher of the Node.js agent. To take advantage of the latest Node.js agent features, upgrade your agent. Instrumenting web transactions To instrument web transactions, such as websocket requests, create a custom transaction. Creating a custom transaction gives you the same type of visibility into that custom transaction that you would get from a transaction that the agent automatically instruments. Wrap the handler you want to instrument with createWebTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. Example: Instrument two transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message example is asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function (data) { socket.emit('pong') nr.endTransaction() })) socket.on('new-message', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function (data) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') nr.endTransaction() }) })) }) Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Instrumenting background transactions You can also use custom transactions to instrument background tasks, such as periodic jobs within your app or work that continues after a request completes. To instrument background tasks, wrap the handler you want to instrument with createBackgroundTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() setInterval(nr.createBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function () { var newValue = someDataGenerator() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { nr.endTransaction() // End the transaction once redis is done }) }), 30000) // Every 30s Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Expanding instrumentation within transactions You can also use custom instrumentation to provide more visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or to gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument callbacks, wrap the callback with createTracer(). If you want to instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, you need to wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with createTracer(). Tip You must place these examples inside an already instrumented transaction. The transaction can be automatically instrumented, or via a custom transaction. Example: Instrument a callback This examples wraps a single callback: // Wrap the callback in a segment db.createObject(nr.createTracer('db:createObject', function (err, result) { // Some error handler that will end the response for us if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() })) Copy Example: Instrument an async function This example wraps both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, we would not get any data from client.query. This allows createTracer() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. pg.connect(config.db_string, nr.createTracer('pg:connect', function (err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count', nr.createTracer('pg:query', function (err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') })) })) Copy",

These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics. What you need New Relic requires an additional native module to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with process.cpuUsage(). The native module can be used with: New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher NPM v2.0.0 or higher To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the node-gyp package procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include: Platform Prerequisites Unix/Linux Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC) macOS Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode Windows Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the installation troubleshooting procedures. Install the native module As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically. During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary. It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module.

With custom instrumentation, you can instrument web sockets, background jobs, and unsupported databases. Custom instrumentation can also target specific sections of your code for deeper insight. Custom instrumentation is available in versions 1.10.0 or higher of the Node.js agent. To take advantage of the latest Node.js agent features, upgrade your agent. Instrumenting web transactions To instrument web transactions, such as websocket requests, create a custom transaction. Creating a custom transaction gives you the same type of visibility into that custom transaction that you would get from a transaction that the agent automatically instruments.

Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. Example: Instrument two transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io.

Instrumenting background transactions You can also use custom transactions to instrument background tasks, such as periodic jobs within your app or work that continues after a request completes. To instrument background tasks, wrap the handler you want to instrument with createBackgroundTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() setInterval(nr.createBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function () { var newValue = someDataGenerator() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { nr.endTransaction() // End the transaction once redis is done }) }), 30000) // Every 30s Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Expanding instrumentation within transactions You can also use custom instrumentation to provide more visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or to gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument callbacks, wrap the callback with createTracer(). If you want to instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, you need to wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with createTracer(). Tip You must place these examples inside an already instrumented transaction. The transaction can be automatically instrumented, or via a custom transaction. Example: Instrument a callback This examples wraps a single callback: // Wrap the callback in a segment db.createObject(nr.createTracer('db:createObject', function (err, result) { // Some error handler that will end the response for us if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() })) Copy Example: Instrument an async function This example wraps both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, we would not get any data from client.query. This allows createTracer() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. pg.connect(config.db_string, nr.createTracer('pg:connect', function (err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count', nr.createTracer('pg:query', function (err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') })) })) Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Node.js agent collects key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine (V8). These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics. What you need New Relic requires an additional native module to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with process.cpuUsage(). The native module can be used with: New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher NPM v2.0.0 or higher To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the node-gyp package procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include: Platform Prerequisites Unix/Linux Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC) macOS Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode Windows Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the installation troubleshooting procedures. Install the native module As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically. During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary. It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module. Do this by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD environment variable to true before installation with either NPM or Yarn. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true Copy npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy Alternatively, use the --no-download flag which works with NPM. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --no-download Copy If the build fails with NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true or the --no-download flag set, the optional native module will not be installed. If both environment variables are set, NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD will override NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD. If you're using an older version, upgrade to the latest agent version, or install the native module manually: Ensure a supported version of Node.js is installed. Recommendation: Use the latest LTS version. Do not use versions lower than the minimum supported version for the @newrelic/native-metrics module (v4 or higher). To get all currently available metrics, ensure you are running the newrelic module for agent 1.37.0 or higher. Windows users: Run the following command: npm install --global windows-build-tools Copy If this step doesn't work, follow Option 2 in the node-gyp module on GitHub for manual installation instructions. To install the native metrics module, use either of these methods: Run the npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --save command. OR Add the module to your app's package.json file. Restart your app. The Node.js agent automatically detects if the native metrics module is installed and starts using it. If you'd like to avoid installation of the native module completely, you can use the following NPM or Yarn arguments. npm install newrelic --no-optional Copy yarn add newrelic --ignore-optional Copy Pre-built binaries To skip the build step and only attempt to download a pre-built binary, and to avoid seeing build errors in the console, set the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD environment variable to true before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD=true Copy If working behind a firewall, you can cache pre-built binaries by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST and NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH environment variables before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://your-internal-cache/ Copy export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH=path/to/download/folder/ Copy Once you've set environment variables, installation can then proceed. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy View Node.js VM data To view curated charts with Node.js VM data, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. For more information, see the Node.js VMs statistics page. The data is also available in the data explorer: To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and at the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. Measurement details Tip Not all data can be collected across all Node versions. In general, you will get the most complete data if you are on the most recent LTS version of Node. Time in garbage collection Available on: Node.js agent v1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher New Relic Node.js @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher The amount of time spent in garbage collection (all types used by V8) by your Node process. Time is measured both as a cumulative metric, as GC/System/Pauses, and bucketed by garbage collection type as GC/<type>. Possible garbage collection types include: GC type Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node v6 or higher. Memory Available on: Node.js agent v1.36.0 or higher Node v4 or higher The New Relic Node.js agent collects the following metrics related to memory usage: Metric Description Memory/Physical The total physical memory (in MB) used by the Node process. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().rss Node API. Memory/Heap/Max The total heap (in MB) allocated by V8 for storing Javascript objects. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapTotal Node API. Memory/Heap/Used The amount of V8 heap (in MB) currently used by the app. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapUsed Node API. Memory/Heap/Free The amount of V8 memory (in MB) that is allocated but not used. This is a derived metric (heapTotal - heapUsed). Memory/NonHeap/Used The amount of memory other than V8 heap (in MB). This is a derived metric (rss - heapTotal). This metric is useful for finding memory leaks outside of V8 heap; for example, with buffers or streams. CPU Available on: Node >= v6.1.0, Agent v1.34.0 or higher Node v4 - v6.0.0, Agent v1.35.2 with @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher CPU metrics are collected on Node v6.1.0 or higher using the process.cpuUsage() Node API. For older versions of Node, the additional native module must be installed. The agent collects the following metrics related to CPU: Metric Description CPU/User Time The time spent by CPU executing the user code. It is recorded in seconds. CPU/User/Utilization The time spent executing the user code (CPU/User Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by the number of cores. CPU/System Time The time spent by CPU in the system kernel in relation to the Node process. CPU/System/Utilization The time spent in the system kernel (CPU/System Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by number of cores. Event Loop Available on: Node.js agent v1.37.0 or higher @newrelic/native-metrics v2.1.0 or higher Node v4 or higher Performance metrics for the Node event loop. Collection of event loop metrics requires installation of an additional native module. The agent collects the following event loop metrics: Metric Description Nodejs/EventLoop/CPU/Usage Copy The total CPU time spent actively executing in each event loop tick. This includes executing your application's callbacks, but also the runtime itself. Reported in units of seconds. An abnormally long event loop tick indicates unbroken synchronous execution that may be a target for optimization; for example, recursive process.nextTick calls).",

Example: Instrument a callback This examples wraps a single callback: // Wrap the callback in a segment db.createObject(nr.createTracer('db:createObject', function (err, result) { // Some error handler that will end the response for us if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() })) Copy Example: Instrument an async function This example wraps both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, we would not get any data from client.query. This allows createTracer() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. pg.connect(config.db_string, nr.createTracer('pg:connect', function (err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count', nr.createTracer('pg:query', function (err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') })) })) Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Node.js agent collects key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine (V8). These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics. What you need New Relic requires an additional native module to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with process.cpuUsage(). The native module can be used with: New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher NPM v2.0.0 or higher To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the node-gyp package procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include: Platform Prerequisites Unix/Linux Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC) macOS Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode Windows Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the installation troubleshooting procedures. Install the native module As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically. During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary. It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module. Do this by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD environment variable to true before installation with either NPM or Yarn. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true Copy npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy Alternatively, use the --no-download flag which works with NPM. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --no-download Copy If the build fails with NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true or the --no-download flag set, the optional native module will not be installed. If both environment variables are set, NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD will override NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD. If you're using an older version, upgrade to the latest agent version, or install the native module manually: Ensure a supported version of Node.js is installed. Recommendation: Use the latest LTS version. Do not use versions lower than the minimum supported version for the @newrelic/native-metrics module (v4 or higher). To get all currently available metrics, ensure you are running the newrelic module for agent 1.37.0 or higher. Windows users: Run the following command: npm install --global windows-build-tools Copy If this step doesn't work, follow Option 2 in the node-gyp module on GitHub for manual installation instructions. To install the native metrics module, use either of these methods: Run the npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --save command. OR Add the module to your app's package.json file. Restart your app. The Node.js agent automatically detects if the native metrics module is installed and starts using it. If you'd like to avoid installation of the native module completely, you can use the following NPM or Yarn arguments. npm install newrelic --no-optional Copy yarn add newrelic --ignore-optional Copy Pre-built binaries To skip the build step and only attempt to download a pre-built binary, and to avoid seeing build errors in the console, set the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD environment variable to true before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD=true Copy If working behind a firewall, you can cache pre-built binaries by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST and NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH environment variables before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://your-internal-cache/ Copy export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH=path/to/download/folder/ Copy Once you've set environment variables, installation can then proceed. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy View Node.js VM data To view curated charts with Node.js VM data, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. For more information, see the Node.js VMs statistics page. The data is also available in the data explorer: To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and at the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. Measurement details Tip Not all data can be collected across all Node versions. In general, you will get the most complete data if you are on the most recent LTS version of Node. Time in garbage collection Available on: Node.js agent v1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher New Relic Node.js @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher The amount of time spent in garbage collection (all types used by V8) by your Node process. Time is measured both as a cumulative metric, as GC/System/Pauses, and bucketed by garbage collection type as GC/<type>. Possible garbage collection types include: GC type Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node v6 or higher. Memory Available on: Node.js agent v1.36.0 or higher Node v4 or higher The New Relic Node.js agent collects the following metrics related to memory usage: Metric Description Memory/Physical The total physical memory (in MB) used by the Node process. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().rss Node API. Memory/Heap/Max The total heap (in MB) allocated by V8 for storing Javascript objects. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapTotal Node API. Memory/Heap/Used The amount of V8 heap (in MB) currently used by the app. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapUsed Node API. Memory/Heap/Free The amount of V8 memory (in MB) that is allocated but not used. This is a derived metric (heapTotal - heapUsed). Memory/NonHeap/Used The amount of memory other than V8 heap (in MB). This is a derived metric (rss - heapTotal). This metric is useful for finding memory leaks outside of V8 heap; for example, with buffers or streams. CPU Available on: Node >= v6.1.0, Agent v1.34.0 or higher Node v4 - v6.0.0, Agent v1.35.2 with @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher CPU metrics are collected on Node v6.1.0 or higher using the process.cpuUsage() Node API. For older versions of Node, the additional native module must be installed. The agent collects the following metrics related to CPU: Metric Description CPU/User Time The time spent by CPU executing the user code. It is recorded in seconds. CPU/User/Utilization The time spent executing the user code (CPU/User Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by the number of cores. CPU/System Time The time spent by CPU in the system kernel in relation to the Node process. CPU/System/Utilization The time spent in the system kernel (CPU/System Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by number of cores. Event Loop Available on: Node.js agent v1.37.0 or higher @newrelic/native-metrics v2.1.0 or higher Node v4 or higher Performance metrics for the Node event loop. Collection of event loop metrics requires installation of an additional native module. The agent collects the following event loop metrics: Metric Description Nodejs/EventLoop/CPU/Usage Copy The total CPU time spent actively executing in each event loop tick. This includes executing your application's callbacks, but also the runtime itself. Reported in units of seconds. An abnormally long event loop tick indicates unbroken synchronous execution that may be a target for optimization; for example, recursive process.nextTick calls).",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With custom instrumentation, you can instrument web sockets, background jobs, and unsupported databases. Custom instrumentation can also target specific sections of your code for deeper insight. Custom instrumentation is available in versions 1.10.0 or higher of the Node.js agent. To take advantage of the latest Node.js agent features, upgrade your agent. Instrumenting web transactions To instrument web transactions, such as websocket requests, create a custom transaction. Creating a custom transaction gives you the same type of visibility into that custom transaction that you would get from a transaction that the agent automatically instruments. Wrap the handler you want to instrument with createWebTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. Example: Instrument two transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message example is asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function (data) { socket.emit('pong') nr.endTransaction() })) socket.on('new-message', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function (data) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') nr.endTransaction() }) })) }) Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Instrumenting background transactions You can also use custom transactions to instrument background tasks, such as periodic jobs within your app or work that continues after a request completes. To instrument background tasks, wrap the handler you want to instrument with createBackgroundTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() setInterval(nr.createBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function () { var newValue = someDataGenerator() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { nr.endTransaction() // End the transaction once redis is done }) }), 30000) // Every 30s Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Expanding instrumentation within transactions You can also use custom instrumentation to provide more visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or to gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument callbacks, wrap the callback with createTracer(). If you want to instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, you need to wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with createTracer(). Tip You must place these examples inside an already instrumented transaction. The transaction can be automatically instrumented, or via a custom transaction. Example: Instrument a callback This examples wraps a single callback: // Wrap the callback in a segment db.createObject(nr.createTracer('db:createObject', function (err, result) { // Some error handler that will end the response for us if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() })) Copy Example: Instrument an async function This example wraps both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, we would not get any data from client.query. This allows createTracer() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. pg.connect(config.db_string, nr.createTracer('pg:connect', function (err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count', nr.createTracer('pg:query', function (err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') })) })) Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's Node.js agent collects key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine (V8). These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics. What you need New Relic requires an additional native module to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with process.cpuUsage(). The native module can be used with: New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher NPM v2.0.0 or higher To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the node-gyp package procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include: Platform Prerequisites Unix/Linux Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC) macOS Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode Windows Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the installation troubleshooting procedures. Install the native module As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically. During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary. It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module. Do this by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD environment variable to true before installation with either NPM or Yarn. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true Copy npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy Alternatively, use the --no-download flag which works with NPM. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --no-download Copy If the build fails with NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true or the --no-download flag set, the optional native module will not be installed. If both environment variables are set, NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD will override NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD. If you're using an older version, upgrade to the latest agent version, or install the native module manually: Ensure a supported version of Node.js is installed. Recommendation: Use the latest LTS version. Do not use versions lower than the minimum supported version for the @newrelic/native-metrics module (v4 or higher). To get all currently available metrics, ensure you are running the newrelic module for agent 1.37.0 or higher. Windows users: Run the following command: npm install --global windows-build-tools Copy If this step doesn't work, follow Option 2 in the node-gyp module on GitHub for manual installation instructions. To install the native metrics module, use either of these methods: Run the npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --save command. OR Add the module to your app's package.json file. Restart your app. The Node.js agent automatically detects if the native metrics module is installed and starts using it. If you'd like to avoid installation of the native module completely, you can use the following NPM or Yarn arguments. npm install newrelic --no-optional Copy yarn add newrelic --ignore-optional Copy Pre-built binaries To skip the build step and only attempt to download a pre-built binary, and to avoid seeing build errors in the console, set the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD environment variable to true before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD=true Copy If working behind a firewall, you can cache pre-built binaries by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST and NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH environment variables before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://your-internal-cache/ Copy export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH=path/to/download/folder/ Copy Once you've set environment variables, installation can then proceed. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy View Node.js VM data To view curated charts with Node.js VM data, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. For more information, see the Node.js VMs statistics page. The data is also available in the data explorer: To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and at the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. Measurement details Tip Not all data can be collected across all Node versions. In general, you will get the most complete data if you are on the most recent LTS version of Node. Time in garbage collection Available on: Node.js agent v1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher New Relic Node.js @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher The amount of time spent in garbage collection (all types used by V8) by your Node process. Time is measured both as a cumulative metric, as GC/System/Pauses, and bucketed by garbage collection type as GC/<type>. Possible garbage collection types include: GC type Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node v6 or higher. Memory Available on: Node.js agent v1.36.0 or higher Node v4 or higher The New Relic Node.js agent collects the following metrics related to memory usage: Metric Description Memory/Physical The total physical memory (in MB) used by the Node process. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().rss Node API. Memory/Heap/Max The total heap (in MB) allocated by V8 for storing Javascript objects. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapTotal Node API. Memory/Heap/Used The amount of V8 heap (in MB) currently used by the app. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapUsed Node API. Memory/Heap/Free The amount of V8 memory (in MB) that is allocated but not used. This is a derived metric (heapTotal - heapUsed). Memory/NonHeap/Used The amount of memory other than V8 heap (in MB). This is a derived metric (rss - heapTotal). This metric is useful for finding memory leaks outside of V8 heap; for example, with buffers or streams. CPU Available on: Node >= v6.1.0, Agent v1.34.0 or higher Node v4 - v6.0.0, Agent v1.35.2 with @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher CPU metrics are collected on Node v6.1.0 or higher using the process.cpuUsage() Node API. For older versions of Node, the additional native module must be installed. The agent collects the following metrics related to CPU: Metric Description CPU/User Time The time spent by CPU executing the user code. It is recorded in seconds. CPU/User/Utilization The time spent executing the user code (CPU/User Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by the number of cores. CPU/System Time The time spent by CPU in the system kernel in relation to the Node process. CPU/System/Utilization The time spent in the system kernel (CPU/System Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by number of cores. Event Loop Available on: Node.js agent v1.37.0 or higher @newrelic/native-metrics v2.1.0 or higher Node v4 or higher Performance metrics for the Node event loop. Collection of event loop metrics requires installation of an additional native module. The agent collects the following event loop metrics: Metric Description Nodejs/EventLoop/CPU/Usage Copy The total CPU time spent actively executing in each event loop tick. This includes executing your application's callbacks, but also the runtime itself. Reported in units of seconds. An abnormally long event loop tick indicates unbroken synchronous execution that may be a target for optimization; for example, recursive process.nextTick calls).",

      "body": "New Relic for Node.js automatically instruments most standard web requests, but sometimes you want expanded instrumentation. With custom instrumentation, you can instrument web sockets, background jobs, and unsupported databases. Custom instrumentation can also target specific sections of your code for deeper insight. Custom instrumentation is available in versions 1.10.0 or higher of the Node.js agent. To take advantage of the latest Node.js agent features, upgrade your agent. Instrumenting web transactions To instrument web transactions, such as websocket requests, create a custom transaction. Creating a custom transaction gives you the same type of visibility into that custom transaction that you would get from a transaction that the agent automatically instruments. Wrap the handler you want to instrument with createWebTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. Example: Instrument two transactions in socket.io This example instruments a /websocket/ping transaction and a /websocket/new-message transaction within socket.io. The /ping example is synchronous, while the /new-message example is asynchronous. var nr = require('newrelic') var app = require('http').createServer() var io = require('socket.io')(app) io.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('ping', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/ping', function (data) { socket.emit('pong') nr.endTransaction() })) socket.on('new-message', nr.createWebTransaction('/websocket/new-message', function (data) { addMessageToChat(data, function () { socket.emit('message-received') nr.endTransaction() }) })) }) Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Instrumenting background transactions You can also use custom transactions to instrument background tasks, such as periodic jobs within your app or work that continues after a request completes. To instrument background tasks, wrap the handler you want to instrument with createBackgroundTransaction(). Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Example: Instrument within setInterval This example instruments update:cache within setInterval: var nr = require('newrelic') var redis = require('redis').createClient() setInterval(nr.createBackgroundTransaction('update:cache', function () { var newValue = someDataGenerator() redis.set('some:cache:key', newValue, function () { nr.endTransaction() // End the transaction once redis is done }) }), 30000) // Every 30s Copy Tip Ensure you call endTransaction() at the end of the transaction. Expanding instrumentation within transactions You can also use custom instrumentation to provide more visibility into web transactions that are already instrumented, or to gain insight into databases and other in-transaction work that is not automatically instrumented. To do this, wrap your callbacks in custom tracers. Custom tracers create and collect specific metrics for an additional segment within an existing transaction, such as a particular function or a database call. To instrument callbacks, wrap the callback with createTracer(). If you want to instrument a function that is called inside an asynchronous function, you need to wrap both the target function and its parent asynchronous function with createTracer(). Tip You must place these examples inside an already instrumented transaction. The transaction can be automatically instrumented, or via a custom transaction. Example: Instrument a callback This examples wraps a single callback: // Wrap the callback in a segment db.createObject(nr.createTracer('db:createObject', function (err, result) { // Some error handler that will end the response for us if (util.handleError(err, res)) { return } res.write(JSON.stringify(result.rows[0].id)) res.write('\\n') res.end() })) Copy Example: Instrument an async function This example wraps both pg.connect and client.query. This is because client.query is called by an asynchronous parent function (pg.connect). Otherwise, we would not get any data from client.query. This allows createTracer() to propagate the active transaction across those asynchronous boundaries. pg.connect(config.db_string, nr.createTracer('pg:connect', function (err, client, done) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } client.query('SELECT count(*) FROM test_count', nr.createTracer('pg:query', function (err, result) { if (util.handleError(err, '500', res)) { return done() } res.write(result.rows[0].count) res.write('\\n') })) })) Copy",

The APM UI will show transactions initiated via RabbitMQ message receipt (subscribe/consume messages) as Message background tasks. Message creation via RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces. This feature requires New Relic Node.js agent version 2.0.0 or higher. Performance improvements with background tasks One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication. In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The amqplib client library allows Node applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9 or higher. New Relic's Node.js agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library. With this visibility, you can see details including: Number of messages produced by your app Time your app spends publishing messages Time your app spends processing \"consumed\" messages APM conveniently groups and reports operations that interact with queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify bottlenecks and areas for performance improvement in your message passing architecture. Queue operations Supported entry points for queue operations appear as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message) in APM's user interface. Queue operations Publish a message (Put in UI) Receive a message (Take in UI) RabbitMQ publish sendToQueue get consume View in New Relic UI Queue operations appear on APM's Transactions page for the selected app. The Put and Take metrics appear in the Breakdown table and are categorized as MessageBroker metrics. Here is an example: one.newrelic.com > APM > Applications > (select an app) > Transactions > (select a transaction): The transaction's Breakdown table categorizes queue operations as MessageBroker metrics and labels them as Put (publish a message) or Take (receive a message). The Transaction trace summary page may show Put and Take operations in the Slowest components section. For example: one.newrelic.com > APM > Applications > (select an app) > Summary > (select a transaction trace): In this example, the selected transaction trace's Summary shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The Slowest components section also lists the RabbitMQ Put and Take results. The Transaction trace page also includes a dedicated Messages tab that shows a summary of the message activity that occurred as part of the transaction.

      "body": "New Relic's Node.js agent collects key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine (V8). These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics. What you need New Relic requires an additional native module to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with process.cpuUsage(). The native module can be used with: New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher NPM v2.0.0 or higher To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the node-gyp package procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include: Platform Prerequisites Unix/Linux Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC) macOS Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode Windows Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the installation troubleshooting procedures. Install the native module As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically. During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary. It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module. Do this by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD environment variable to true before installation with either NPM or Yarn. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true Copy npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy Alternatively, use the --no-download flag which works with NPM. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --no-download Copy If the build fails with NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true or the --no-download flag set, the optional native module will not be installed. If both environment variables are set, NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD will override NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD. If you're using an older version, upgrade to the latest agent version, or install the native module manually: Ensure a supported version of Node.js is installed. Recommendation: Use the latest LTS version. Do not use versions lower than the minimum supported version for the @newrelic/native-metrics module (v4 or higher). To get all currently available metrics, ensure you are running the newrelic module for agent 1.37.0 or higher. Windows users: Run the following command: npm install --global windows-build-tools Copy If this step doesn't work, follow Option 2 in the node-gyp module on GitHub for manual installation instructions. To install the native metrics module, use either of these methods: Run the npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --save command. OR Add the module to your app's package.json file. Restart your app. The Node.js agent automatically detects if the native metrics module is installed and starts using it. If you'd like to avoid installation of the native module completely, you can use the following NPM or Yarn arguments. npm install newrelic --no-optional Copy yarn add newrelic --ignore-optional Copy Pre-built binaries To skip the build step and only attempt to download a pre-built binary, and to avoid seeing build errors in the console, set the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD environment variable to true before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD=true Copy If working behind a firewall, you can cache pre-built binaries by setting the NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST and NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH environment variables before installation. export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://your-internal-cache/ Copy export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH=path/to/download/folder/ Copy Once you've set environment variables, installation can then proceed. npm install @newrelic/native-metrics Copy yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics Copy View Node.js VM data To view curated charts with Node.js VM data, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Node VMs. For more information, see the Node.js VMs statistics page. The data is also available in the data explorer: To access the data explorer, go to one.newrelic.com and at the top of the page, click the Query your data icon. Measurement details Tip Not all data can be collected across all Node versions. In general, you will get the most complete data if you are on the most recent LTS version of Node. Time in garbage collection Available on: Node.js agent v1.35.1 or higher Node v4 or higher New Relic Node.js @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher The amount of time spent in garbage collection (all types used by V8) by your Node process. Time is measured both as a cumulative metric, as GC/System/Pauses, and bucketed by garbage collection type as GC/<type>. Possible garbage collection types include: GC type Description Scavenge The most common garbage collection method. Node will typically trigger one of these every time the VM is idle. MarkSweepCompact The heaviest type of garbage collection V8 may do. If you see many of these happening you will need to either keep fewer objects around in your process or increase V8's heap limit. IncrementalMarking A phased garbage collection that interleaves collection with application logic to reduce the amount of time the application is paused. Only in Node v6 or higher. ProcessWeakCallbacks After a garbage collection occurs, V8 will call any weak reference callbacks registered for objects that have been freed. This measurement is from the start of the first weak callback to the end of the last for a given garbage collection. Only in Node v6 or higher. Memory Available on: Node.js agent v1.36.0 or higher Node v4 or higher The New Relic Node.js agent collects the following metrics related to memory usage: Metric Description Memory/Physical The total physical memory (in MB) used by the Node process. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().rss Node API. Memory/Heap/Max The total heap (in MB) allocated by V8 for storing Javascript objects. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapTotal Node API. Memory/Heap/Used The amount of V8 heap (in MB) currently used by the app. It is recorded using the process.memoryUsage().heapUsed Node API. Memory/Heap/Free The amount of V8 memory (in MB) that is allocated but not used. This is a derived metric (heapTotal - heapUsed). Memory/NonHeap/Used The amount of memory other than V8 heap (in MB). This is a derived metric (rss - heapTotal). This metric is useful for finding memory leaks outside of V8 heap; for example, with buffers or streams. CPU Available on: Node >= v6.1.0, Agent v1.34.0 or higher Node v4 - v6.0.0, Agent v1.35.2 with @newrelic/native-metrics v1.0.0 or higher CPU metrics are collected on Node v6.1.0 or higher using the process.cpuUsage() Node API. For older versions of Node, the additional native module must be installed. The agent collects the following metrics related to CPU: Metric Description CPU/User Time The time spent by CPU executing the user code. It is recorded in seconds. CPU/User/Utilization The time spent executing the user code (CPU/User Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by the number of cores. CPU/System Time The time spent by CPU in the system kernel in relation to the Node process. CPU/System/Utilization The time spent in the system kernel (CPU/System Time) divided by wall clock time and the number of logical processors. Because the Node runtime always uses only one core, the max value reported by this metric will be 100 divided by number of cores. Event Loop Available on: Node.js agent v1.37.0 or higher @newrelic/native-metrics v2.1.0 or higher Node v4 or higher Performance metrics for the Node event loop. Collection of event loop metrics requires installation of an additional native module. The agent collects the following event loop metrics: Metric Description Nodejs/EventLoop/CPU/Usage Copy The total CPU time spent actively executing in each event loop tick. This includes executing your application's callbacks, but also the runtime itself. Reported in units of seconds. An abnormally long event loop tick indicates unbroken synchronous execution that may be a target for optimization; for example, recursive process.nextTick calls).",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 18 October 2022 April-October 2022 16 October 2021 July 26, 2021 with Node.js agent v8.0.0 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 26, 2021, we have discontinued support for Node.js 10 with v8 of the Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) Fastify If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021. This includes the Oracle Driver Package and Hapi versions prior to Hapi 19.2 for our Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Processors The New Relic Node Agent is built to run on most processors including being tested and validated to work on AWS Graviton2 Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent can add the benefits of browser monitoring when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent. Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

The Java agent reports the database name and database server/identifier attributes on slow query traces and transaction traces for these database drivers. To request instance-level information from additional datastores, get support at support.newrelic.com. Hosting services You can install the Java agent on a variety of hosting services, including ones not listed below. Here are detailed installation guides for particular hosting services: Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment Heroku Asynchronous instrumentation For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, you can use the Java agent API to extend this instrumentation. Other instrumented features EJB Session Beans 3.0 or higher JMX JSP (Java Server Pages) 2.0 to 2.2 Scala 2.9.3 to 2.13.x Connect the agent to other New Relic products The Java agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Java agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information: Large memory usage: If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions. Troubleshooting your Node.js installation: Try these steps if you don't see any data, cannot log files, or encounter other installation problems with the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting browser instrumentation: If you encounter problems with browser data, see these additional tips for Node.js. You can also view all troubleshooting docs.

      "body": "The New Relic Node.js agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Node.js agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to off. When set to off, the agent does not capture slow queries and does not include backtraces or SQL in transaction traces. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. The record_sql configuration setting is changed to obfuscated, which strips out string and numeric literals. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Node.js agent configuration file Custom attributes Node.js agent API Setting Effects on data security audit_log.enabled boolean Default: false By default, the agent does not log all data sent to New Relic in the agent log file. If you set this to true, the agent logs the data sent to the New Relic collector in the agent log file. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends by reviewing the agent log file to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. record_sql string Default: off By default, record_sql is set to off. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to obfuscated. You can change this setting to adjust the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector. If you do not want the agent to capture slow queries or to include backtraces and SQL in transaction traces, set this to off. If you want the agent to strip out string and numeric literals, set this to obfuscated. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw.",

For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible.

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 18 October 2022 April-October 2022 16 October 2021 July 26, 2021 with Node.js agent v8.0.0 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 26, 2021, we have discontinued support for Node.js 10 with v8 of the Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) Fastify If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021. This includes the Oracle Driver Package and Hapi versions prior to Hapi 19.2 for our Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Processors The New Relic Node Agent is built to run on most processors including being tested and validated to work on AWS Graviton2 Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent can add the benefits of browser monitoring when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent. Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Node.js agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to off. When set to off, the agent does not capture slow queries and does not include backtraces or SQL in transaction traces. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters.

This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. record_sql string Default: off By default, record_sql is set to off. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to obfuscated. You can change this setting to adjust the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector. If you do not want the agent to capture slow queries or to include backtraces and SQL in transaction traces, set this to off.

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent includes built-in instrumentation of the most popular parts of the Java ecosystem, including app servers, frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Here we describe special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with New Relic's Node.js agent. Install the agent add-on After deploying your Node.js app on Heroku, install the New Relic agent. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website's Add-on page for New Relic, you must be logged in to Heroku. From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select the appropriate subscription plan. Then run this toolbelt command: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Use this toolbelt command to give your app a descriptive name: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy If you are using environment variables instead of your newrelic.js config file settings to customize your Node.js agent configuration, use this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE='true' Copy Verify your New Relic app name, license key, and log setting: heroku config Copy Install the Node.js agent and save to your npm dependencies. npm install newrelic --save Copy To ensure that the newrelic package is properly included in your package.json file when you push to Heroku, install the New Relic Node.js agent package on your local system. Include New Relic on the first line of your app's main module: require ('newrelic'); Copy Run the following commands: git add . && git commit -m \"Add New Relic\" git push heroku master && heroku logs --tail Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. New Relic will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Troubleshoot your installation If no data appears within a few minutes after you complete the installation procedures, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Customize your configuration You can customize the New Relic newrelic.js config file for your Node.js agent. You can also use New Relic's Node.js agent environment variables in the Heroku environment to override your config file values. Here is an example of using the Heroku command line to set environment variables instead of using your newrelic.js config file. $ heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=your license key $ heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=your production app name $ heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE='true' Copy To confirm your settings from the command line, use: $ heroku config Copy Upgrade from an existing New Relic installation To upgrade your Node.js agent version if New Relic is already installed, use this toolbelt command: npm install newrelic --save Copy",

What you need In addition to the Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent, this tutorial assumes you have a working installation of Node.js and the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js for your platform: Install the Azure SDK for Node.js. Ensure Git is installed. Installing the Node.js agent To add the New Relic Node.js agent to your Azure application: In your app's root, verify that there is a package.json file. If there is not, create one via the command line: touch package.json Copy Add the following to your package.json file: { \"name\": \"node\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"dependencies\" : { \"newrelic\" : \"*\" }, \"engine\": { \"node\": \"10.18\" } } Copy Add require('newrelic'); to the top of the server.js file. For example: require('newrelic'); var http = require('http') var port = process.env.PORT || 1337; http.createServer(function(req, res) { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }); res.end('Hello New Relic Node.js agent!\\n'); }).listen(port); Copy Adding app settings in Azure After installation, you must configure your app in Azure Web Apps: Sign in to portal.azure.com. Select App Services > (select a Node.js app) > Configure. Add the following to the app settings: new_relic_app_name: Your Windows Azure website name new_relic_license_key: Your New Relic license key Save your settings. Restart your Node.js app. Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. After waiting, see your data by going to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select your app). Optional: Adding app settings with the CLI Optional: Here is an example of how to add the app settings by using the CLI (Node SDK): azure account download \"YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME\" azure account import \"PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE\" azure site config add \"new_relic_app_name=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME\" azure site config add \"new_relic_license_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" azure site restart AZURE_WEB_APP_NAME Copy Using environment variables If your agent runs in PaaS environments such as Heroku or Azure Web Apps, all of the configuration variables in newrelic.js have counterparts that can be set as environment variables. You can freely mix and match variables in the configuration file. Environment variables override your configuration file settings. For example, as a convenience to Azure users, the agent will use APP_POOL_ID as the application name (NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME) if it's set, so you can use the name you chose without setting it twice. For more information, see Configuring Node.js with environment variables.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

What you need In addition to the Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent, this tutorial assumes you have a working installation of Node.js and the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js for your platform: Install the Azure SDK for Node.js. Ensure Git is installed. Installing the Node.js agent To add the New Relic Node.js agent to your Azure application: In your app's root, verify that there is a package.json file. If there is not, create one via the command line: touch package.json Copy Add the following to your package.json file: { \"name\": \"node\", \"version\": \"0.0.1\", \"dependencies\" : { \"newrelic\" : \"*\" }, \"engine\": { \"node\": \"10.18\" } } Copy Add require('newrelic'); to the top of the server.js file. For example: require('newrelic'); var http = require('http') var port = process.env.PORT || 1337; http.createServer(function(req, res) { res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }); res.end('Hello New Relic Node.js agent!\\n'); }).listen(port); Copy Adding app settings in Azure After installation, you must configure your app in Azure Web Apps: Sign in to portal.azure.com. Select App Services > (select a Node.js app) > Configure. Add the following to the app settings: new_relic_app_name: Your Windows Azure website name new_relic_license_key: Your New Relic license key Save your settings. Restart your Node.js app. Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. After waiting, see your data by going to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select your app). Optional: Adding app settings with the CLI Optional: Here is an example of how to add the app settings by using the CLI (Node SDK): azure account download \"YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME\" azure account import \"PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE\" azure site config add \"new_relic_app_name=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME\" azure site config add \"new_relic_license_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" azure site restart AZURE_WEB_APP_NAME Copy Using environment variables If your agent runs in PaaS environments such as Heroku or Azure Web Apps, all of the configuration variables in newrelic.js have counterparts that can be set as environment variables. You can freely mix and match variables in the configuration file. Environment variables override your configuration file settings. For example, as a convenience to Azure users, the agent will use APP_POOL_ID as the application name (NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME) if it's set, so you can use the name you chose without setting it twice.

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Node.js. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Here we describe special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with New Relic's Node.js agent. Install the agent add-on After deploying your Node.js app on Heroku, install the New Relic agent. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku servers. To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website's Add-on page for New Relic, you must be logged in to Heroku. From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select the appropriate subscription plan. Then run this toolbelt command: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Use this toolbelt command to give your app a descriptive name: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy If you are using environment variables instead of your newrelic.js config file settings to customize your Node.js agent configuration, use this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE='true' Copy Verify your New Relic app name, license key, and log setting: heroku config Copy Install the Node.js agent and save to your npm dependencies. npm install newrelic --save Copy To ensure that the newrelic package is properly included in your package.json file when you push to Heroku, install the New Relic Node.js agent package on your local system. Include New Relic on the first line of your app's main module: require ('newrelic'); Copy Run the following commands: git add . && git commit -m \"Add New Relic\" git push heroku master && heroku logs --tail Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. New Relic will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Troubleshoot your installation If no data appears within a few minutes after you complete the installation procedures, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Customize your configuration You can customize the New Relic newrelic.js config file for your Node.js agent. You can also use New Relic's Node.js agent environment variables in the Heroku environment to override your config file values.

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent API allows you to extend the agent's standard functionality. You can use this API to: Create custom transaction parameters Report custom errors and metrics You can also use the API for custom instrumentation. For supported frameworks, the agent instruments most activity automatically. Custom instrumentation lets you extend that monitoring to frameworks without default instrumentation. Other resources: The Node.js agent API documentation on GitHub has more detail and practical tutorials. You can also adjust the Node.js agent's default behavior with configuration settings. To see all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Requirements To use the Node.js agent API, make sure you have the latest Node.js agent release. In addition, see: Node.js agent API requirements Getting started procedures on GitHub Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Start timing a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See newrelic.startWebTransaction(). Stop timing a method after its work is completed Use either of these options: Return a promise from the callback handed to newrelic.startWebTransaction. Call end on a handle returned from newrelic.getTransaction. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction using any of these options: See Rules for ignoring requests. Call ignore() on a handle returned from newrelic.getTransaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use this method when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See newrelic.startSegment(). For more information about timing, see the instrumentation tutorial on GitHub. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in New Relic, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name might not be helpful. (Perhaps it is causing a metric grouping issue.) You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them . Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in New Relic: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See newrelic.setTransactionName and rules.name. Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. (Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Node.js agent.) See newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). Create a new transaction for background work See newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Create a new web transaction Use newrelic.startWebTransaction(). Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Rules for naming and ignoring requests, including the ignoring rules example. Record other performance data, such as timing or computer resource data Use the custom metrics API. See related logs To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use these API calls to annotate your logs: newrelic.getTraceMetadata newrelic.getLinkingMetadata For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our logs in context documentation. Instrument asynchronous work For supported frameworks and supported Node.js versions, New Relic's Node.js agent usually correctly instruments async work. However, if your app uses another framework, or if the default async instrumentation is inaccurate, you can explicitly track async work. If you want to... Do this... Trace an async method that New Relic is already instrumenting See newrelic.startSegment. Trace an async method that New Relic is not instrumenting See newrelic.startSegment. Trace a transaction that got lost See newrelic.startSegment. You can also create your own custom instrumentation for libraries that are losing your transactions. Trace a lost transaction state A common issue is the loss of transaction state while using uninstrumented libraries. For more information, see the transaction preservation tutorial on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services Once the request naming API loads, New Relic's Node.js agent can automatically identify external service calls. You can also use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Use any of these as appropriate: Custom instrumentation API Message queues Also see the tutorials on GitHub for datastore shims and message shims. Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Use cross application tracing. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See newrelic.noticeError(). Send custom event and metric data from your app New Relic includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic Create a custom event. See newrelic.recordCustomEvent(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them Add custom attributes if needed. (Custom attribute collection is enabled by default in the Node.js agent.) See newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See newrelic.recordMetric() and newrelic.incrementMetric(). To view the data, use the data explorer. Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add browser apps to New Relic. You can also control the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Extend custom instrumentation The newrelic.instrument() provides additional flexibility for custom instrumentation. For more information, including tutorials and examples, see the shims documentation on GitHub.",

Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Either way, you need a New Relic account if you don't already have one. (It's free, forever!) Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v4.0.1 @newrelic/koa v6.0.1 @newrelic/native-metrics v7.0.1 @newrelic/superagent v5.0.1 @newrelic/test-utilities v6.0.0 Node version support Node v12 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v8 agent. Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

Either way, you need a New Relic account if you don't already have one. (It's free, forever!) Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release.

The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true.

Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value. Framework minimum versions as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: Module V2 minimum Minimum before v2 express 4.6.0 2.0.0 mysql 2.0.0 0.9.0",

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Either way, you need a New Relic account if you don't already have one. (It's free, forever!) Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting After you update the agent, generate some traffic and wait a few minutes. If no data appears in the New Relic UI, see the troubleshooting procedures.",

      "body": "To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the Node.js agent release notes. The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and install the latest version. If the newrelic module is listed in your package.json, run npm install. If you want to target just the newrelic module, run npm update newrelic. Recommendation: Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent troubleshooting procedures. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 Before upgrading to Node.js version 8, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v8 Comments Added official parity support for Node 16. BREAKING: Dropped Node v10.x support. For further information see our support policy. BREAKING: Removed serverless_mode as a feature flag. The standard serverless_mode configuration still exists. BREAKING: The agent no-longer includes the New Relic certificate bundle automatically when using the 'certificates' configuration (commonly with proxies). If you find this breaking your current environment, you may leverage a feature-flag to temporarily restore this functionality. Example configuration: feature_flag: { certificate_bundle: true }. In this case, we recommend getting a certificate bundle for your environment such as the one from Mozilla. The New Relic bundle and feature flag will be fully removed in next major release. Defaulted config.feature_flags.certificate_bundle to false. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v4.0.1 @newrelic/koa v6.0.1 @newrelic/native-metrics v7.0.1 @newrelic/superagent v5.0.1 @newrelic/test-utilities v6.0.0 Node version support Node v12 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v8 agent. Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 Before upgrading to Node.js version 7, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v7 Comments BREAKING Removed deprecated httpResponseCode, response.status and httpResponseMessage http response attributes v6.4.2-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.2, these attributes were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new attributes. v7: When http response attribute reporting is enabled, http.statusCode and http.statusText will be reported. BREAKING Removed deprecated setIgnoreTransaction API method v5 - v6: Starting in agent v5.0.0, this method was marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API method transactionHandle.ignore(). BREAKING Removed the api.custom_parameters_enabled configuration item and associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_PARAMETERS. Applications must use the configuration api.custom_attributes_enabled or the associated environment variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES to enable newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. BREAKING Removed deprecated Distributed Tracing API methods, createDistributedTracePayload() and acceptDistributedTracePayload() v6.4.0-v6.14.0: Starting in agent v6.4.0, these method were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v7: Applications must use the API methods transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) . With these methods, the Node agent will now accept W3C's traceparent and tracestate headers when calling transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) and include the W3C headers along with the New Relic distributed tracing header when calling transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers), unless the New Relic trace header format is disabled using distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header:true. Update New Relic Dependencies to versions with updated Node version support @newrelic/aws-sdk v3.0.0 @newrelic/koa v5.0.0 @newrelic/native-metrics v6.0.0 @newrelic/superagent v4.0.0 @newrelic/test-utilities v5.0.0 Node version support Node v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node 9 and earlier have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 10 does not receive updates. Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 6 Before upgrading to Node.js agent version 6, review this information for major changes. Major changes with Node.js agent v6 Comments Upgraded official Koa framework instrumentation module to v3.0.0 v6: Added support for @koa/router up to v8.0.2. @koa/router v8.0.3 and greater are currently unsupported. v6: Added support for Node v12 and removed support for Node v6, 7, and 9. The minimum supported version is Node v8. Also see New Relic's Koa Release Notes on Github.. Removed deprecated max_samples_per_minute configuration parameter, which is replaced by max_samples_stored behavior v1 - v5: max_samples_per_minute defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used max_samples_per_minute as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k. v5: In agent v5 and lower, max_samples_stored defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. v6: The new behavior of max_samples_stored defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents. Troubleshooting tips: If you're missing event data, increase the value of max_samples_stored or revert to the default value. The value of max_samples_stored should not be over 10,000. Node version support Node 8 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v6 agent. Node 6, 7 and 9 are not supported by v6. Customers running Node 6, 7 and 9 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v6 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v5 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 8 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 8. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 5 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v5, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v5 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v5 agent Comments Removed deprecated addCustomParameter methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period for the new methods. v5: Applications must use the API methods newrelic.addCustomAttribute() and newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). These are drop-in replacements for the old methods. Removed deprecated create*Transaction methods. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.0.2, these methods were marked as deprecated but left in to give a transition period to the new methods. v5: Applications must update to the API methods newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Troubleshooting tips: These new methods are not drop-in replacements for the old ones. Before moving to these new methods, review our custom instrumentation guide. Removed deprecated createTracer method. v3 - v4: Starting in agent v3.3.0, this method was marked as deprecated in favor of newrelic.startSegment(). v5: Applications must update to newrelic.startSegment(). Removed node-cassandra-cql instrumentation. v4: Applications using the npm package node-cassandra-cql would get datastore metrics for Cassandra. v5: Applications must migrate to the cassandra-driver package to get Cassandra datastore metrics. This module is actively maintained by the same developers. The node-cassandra-cql package was abandoned in February of 2014 in favor of the cassandra-driver package. Removed deprecated capture_params and ignored_params configurations. v2 - v4: Starting in agent v2.7.0, these configuration parameters caused a warning to be logged, and the values were automatically upgraded to the new attributes configurations. v5: A warning will still be logged but the configuration is ignored, and no automatic upgrading happens any more. Troubleshooting tips: If your application had parameters listed in the ignored_params configuration, you will need to move them to attributes.exclude. Node version support Node 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node 4 or 5 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions. Node 7 and 9 no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 6 and 7. Feature flags as of v5 As of New Relic for Node.js v5: custom_instrumentation: This feature is no longer configurable. custom_metrics: This feature is no longer configurable. synthetics: This feature is no longer configurable. native_metrics: This feature is now controlled by the plugins.native_metrics.enabled configuration value. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub. Upgrade https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2 Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the https-proxy-agent from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a security issue in the https-proxy-agent that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because https-proxy v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent. Node version support Node 4 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v4 agent. Node 0.10 and 0.12 are not supported by v4. Customers running Node 0.10 or 0.12 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v4 agent's new features. Remain on the New Relic Node.js v3 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 4, 5, and 7 also no longer receive updates, but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node for the time being. Tip Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 4 and 5. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 3 Before upgrading to Node.js agent agent v3, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v3 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Major changes with Node.js v3 agent Comments Removed SSL configuration v2: With the v2 agent, it was possible to configure the agent to connect to New Relic without encryption. v3: Node.js agent v3 always connects to New Relic servers using TLS encryption to protect communications. If the agent is configured to disable this, a warning is logged and the setting is ignored. Request parameters now prefixed with request.parameters. v2: The v2 agent collects request parameters, such as route parameters (/users/:userId) and query parameters (/users?userId=123), as the parameter name (userId). v3: The v3 agent prefixes all request parameters with the string request.parameters.. For example,userId appears as request.parameters.userId. Troubleshooting tips: If you have dashboards, alert policies, or other NRQL queries based on request parameters, update them with the new parameter names. Feature flags as of v3 As of New Relic Node.js agent v3, the send_request_uri_attribute feature is no longer configurable. Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub. Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Major changes with Node.js v2 agent Comments Reversed naming and ignore rules v1: With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties rules.name and rules.ignore were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last. v2: Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first. Troubleshooting tips: If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration. De-duplicated HTTP request transactions v1: The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's request event. In applications with multiple listeners on the request event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly. v2: The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each request event emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you used multiple request event listeners and added a call to newrelic.ignoreTransaction() to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls. Stopped swallowing outbound request errors v1: The v1 agent swallowed unhandled error events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects. v2: The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node execution. This means the error event will always be emitted. Troubleshooting tips: If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the error event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application. Updated configuration options as of v2 In newrelic.js, edit the Node.js agent configuration properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions: Deprecated property New property capture_params attributes.enabled: false By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set attributes.enabled: true to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The capture_params property has been deprecated. ignored_params attributes.exclude: [] Add any request attribute keys to the attributes.exclude list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (*) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The ignored_params property has been deprecated. These Node.js agent configuration properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including: transaction_tracer transaction_events error_collector browser_monitoring For example, if the root attributes.enabled is true and you set transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others. Deprecated API methods as of v2 The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way. newrelic.createWebTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.createBackgroundTransaction() Replace with newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() and newrelic.getTransaction(). newrelic.addCustomParameter() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttribute(). newrelic.addCustomParameters() Replace with newrelic.addCustomAttributes(). New v2 agent API methods The following API methods are new with the New Relic Node.js v2 agent. newrelic.getTransaction() This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with: newrelic.startWebTransaction newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction Callback-based message consumer services for troubleshooting message consumers newrelic.startWebTransaction()newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() These new API methods replace the older create*Transaction methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately. newrelic.instrument()newrelic.instrumentDatastore()newrelic.instrumentWebframework()newrelic.instrumentMessages() Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorials on GitHub. newrelic.addCustomAttribute() Use this method to add a custom trace attribute. newrelic.addCustomAttributes() Use this method to add multiple custom trace attributes. Node version support for v2 The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options: Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features. Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions. Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates, but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being. Recommendation: Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. npm version support as of v2 The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher. If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2: $ npm install --global npm@2 Copy Feature flags as of v2 As of New Relic Node.js agent v2: express_segments: This feature is no longer configurable. cat: This feature is now controlled by the cross_application_tracer.enabled configuration value.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed.

      "body": "Problem If you have encountered any of these common problems after installing your New Relic Node.js agent, try these troubleshooting tips. Solution Some common problems users encounter after installing the New Relic Node.js agent include: Not seeing data To minimize the amount of bandwidth the Node.js agent consumes, New Relic only reports data once per minute. If you add the agent to tests that take less than a minute to run, it will not have time to report data to New Relic. If you do not see transaction traces or other data after deploying the agent, this may be due to configuration, framework, or Apdex settings. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Installation problems What to check Comments Main module Ensure that you have added require('newrelic'); as the first line of the app's main module. If the require is added later, the Node.js agent may not properly instrument your application. Conditional logic If you have any conditional logic in your require, move the conditional logic to your newrelic.js configuration file. Frameworks For problems with supported frameworks, make sure you are using Connect, Express, Hapi, Kraken, or Restify. There are other Node.js frameworks, but New Relic does not support all of them. Apdex For problems with your Apdex results, try adjusting your Apdex score via your Node.js agent config file (newrelic.js) or the New Relic user interface. Log files The Node.js agent writes its log to the newrelic_agent.log file in the application directory, unless you have changed the logging settings. If the agent does not send data or crashes your app, you can generate a troubleshooting log file to accompany bug reports and support requests. Missing VM metrics The agent can collect VM metrics related to garbage collection (GC), memory, and CPU. Some of these metrics require an additional native module to be installed. Here are some common problems and their solutions: Problem During installation, npm shows one of the following error messages: gyp ERR! configure error gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable. Copy gyp ERR! build error gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make Copy make: g++: Command not found Copy Solution Ensure that the prerequisites for the node-gyp module are installed. On Debian/Ubuntu platforms, use this command: apt-get install build-essential Copy For more information, see Node.js VM measurements.

For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes.

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters.

Solution Some common problems users encounter after installing the New Relic Node.js agent include: Not seeing data To minimize the amount of bandwidth the Node.js agent consumes, New Relic only reports data once per minute. If you add the agent to tests that take less than a minute to run, it will not have time to report data to New Relic. If you do not see transaction traces or other data after deploying the agent, this may be due to configuration, framework, or Apdex settings. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Installation problems What to check Comments Main module Ensure that you have added require('newrelic'); as the first line of the app's main module. If the require is added later, the Node.js agent may not properly instrument your application. Conditional logic If you have any conditional logic in your require, move the conditional logic to your newrelic.js configuration file. Frameworks For problems with supported frameworks, make sure you are using Connect, Express, Hapi, Kraken, or Restify. There are other Node.js frameworks, but New Relic does not support all of them. Apdex For problems with your Apdex results, try adjusting your Apdex score via your Node.js agent config file (newrelic.js) or the New Relic user interface. Log files The Node.js agent writes its log to the newrelic_agent.log file in the application directory, unless you have changed the logging settings. If the agent does not send data or crashes your app, you can generate a troubleshooting log file to accompany bug reports and support requests. Missing VM metrics The agent can collect VM metrics related to garbage collection (GC), memory, and CPU. Some of these metrics require an additional native module to be installed. Here are some common problems and their solutions: Problem During installation, npm shows one of the following error messages: gyp ERR! configure error gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable. Copy gyp ERR! build error gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make Copy make: g++: Command not found Copy Solution Ensure that the prerequisites for the node-gyp module are installed.

Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module.

Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters.

      "body": "You can tailor the Node.js agent to your app's requirements by editing your newrelic.js config file or by setting an environment variable. The config file resides in the root directory of your app. You can also configure a few options from New Relic, or use the Node.js agent API. Get started You'll be able to configure our Node.js agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the Node.js agent. The license_key setting is required. Also, we highly recommend setting the app_name so that your app has a meaningful name instead of the default My Application. Configuration methods and precedence The primary method to configure the Node.js agent is the agent configuration file (newrelic.js). You can also configure most settings with environment variables. You can also adjust some settings with server-side configuration. The Node.js agent uses this order of precedence for configuration methods: Node.js configuration hierarchy: Server-side configuration settings override environment variables. Environment variables override the agent config file. The config file overrides the agent defaults. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Agent configuration file The config file (newrelic.js) contains every Node.js agent setting. When you install the Node.js agent, you must copy newrelic.js into your app's root directory. Most settings are empty by default; they inherit their values from config/default.js. Environment variables Most configuration settings in newrelic.js have equivalent environment variables. These are useful, for example, if your agent runs in a PaaS environment such as Heroku or Microsoft Azure. Node.js agent environment variables always start with NEW_RELIC_. Where available, these environment variables are documented below under individual config options as the Environ variable. There are also two rarely used settings that can only be configured via environment variables. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Server-side configuration Owners and Admins can view and configure a few settings directly in New Relic. Where available, the UI labels for server-side config are listed in this document under individual config options as the Server-side label. Exports variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the exports.config = { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. app_name (REQUIRED) Type String Default \"My Application\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME The name New Relic uses to identify your app. For example, app_name: ['MyNodeApp']. To use multiple names for your app, specify a comma-delimited list of names. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in the New Relic UI, so set this carefully. We highly recommend that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Tip For Azure users, the Node.js agent will use APP_POOL_ID if it is set, so you can use the name you chose for your Azure Web Server without setting it twice. license_key (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY This setting is required. Your New Relic license key. For example, license_key: '40HexadecimalCharacters'. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENABLED Set to false to stop the agent from starting up. This is useful when debugging your code requires temporarily disabling the agent. It prevents the agent from bootstrapping its instrumentation or setting up all its pieces, which prevents the agent from starting up and connecting to New Relic's servers. allow_all_headers If true, enables capture of all HTTP headers, except for those filtered by exclude rules. If false, collected headers are limited to those defined in Node.js agent attributes. Type Boolean Default false Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. apdex_t (DEPRECATED) Type Number Default 0.100 Server-side label Apdex T Set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. certificates Type Array of strings Default (none) Additional certificates to trust for SSL connections, specified as an array of strings in PEM format. This affects both connections to an HTTPS proxy and connections to New Relic. Tip You can also configure the agent to read its certificates from a file: certificates: [ fs.readFileSync('myca.crt', {encoding: 'utf8'}) ] Copy high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY When set to true, enables high security v2. You must also enable the ssl setting and enable high security in the UI. host Type String Default collector.newrelic.com Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HOST Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Hostname for the New Relic collector to connect to the Internet; for example, host: 'collector.newrelic.com'. labels Adds tags. Specify your tags as objects or a semicolon-delimited string of colon-separated pairs (for example, Server:One;Data Center:Primary). Type Object or string Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PORT Important Do not edit this value unless New Relic Support asks you to change it. Port number to connect to the New Relic collector; for example, port: 443. proxy Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL A URL specifying the proxy server to connect to the Internet. For example, proxy: 'http://user:pass@10.0.0.1:8000/'. Important The proxy config file setting overrides the other config file proxy settings (proxy_host, proxy_port, proxy_user, proxy_pass) if used. Similarly, the NEW_RELIC_PROXY_URL environment variable overrides the other environment variable proxy settings (NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT, NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER, and NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS) if used. proxy_host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_pass Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Password for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. proxy_port Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Port number of the proxy server to connect to the Internet. proxy_user Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER User name for authenticating to the proxy server. The agent supports only basic HTTP authentication. Logging variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the logging: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type String Default true (false in serverless_mode) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED Enables or disables agent specific logging. level Type String Default info Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Defines the level of detail recorded in the agent logs. From least detail to most detail, possible values are fatal, error, warn, info, debug, or trace. Caution Do not use debug or trace logging unless New Relic Support asks you to use them. These levels of logging can generate excessive overhead. For most situations, use info. filepath Type String Default process.cwd() plus newrelic_agent.log Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG Complete path to the New Relic agent log, including the filename. Defaults to filepath: require('path').join(process.cwd(), 'newrelic_agent.log'). The agent will shut down the process if it cannot create this file. The agent creates a log file with the same permissions as the parent Node.js agent process. To write all logging to stdout, set this to stdout. To write all logging to stderr, set this to stderr. Audit logging This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the audit_log: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENABLED When enabled, the agent logs the payloads it sends to the collector. This data is included in the main log file even when logging level is set to the lowest level. endpoints Type Array Default Empty array (include all types) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AUDIT_LOG_ENDPOINTS The agent sends several different types of data to the collector in separate payloads. By default, all of them are included in the log file. This option makes it possible to limit logging only to specific types of data. Valid values include: agent_settings analytic_event_data connect custom_event_data error_data error_event_data metric_data preconnect shutdown span_event_data sql_trace_data transaction_sample_data API configuration This section allows you to choose which API methods are enabled. Each configuration option allows you to modularly enable API methods that are responsible for sending custom information to New Relic. Important All of these are set to false when the agent is in high security mode. custom_attributes_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES This option enables newrelic.addCustomAttribute and newrelic.addCustomAttributes. custom_events_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_CUSTOM_EVENTS This option enables recordCustomEvent. notice_error_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_API_NOTICE_ERROR This option enables newrelic.noticeError. Attributes This section defines the variables for Node.js agent attributes in the order they typically appear in the attributes: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, enables capture of attributes for all destinations. exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include from all destinations. Allows * as wildcard at end. include_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE_ENABLED When true, patterns may be added to the attributes.include list. Error collector variables You can manage how error are handled in New Relic. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the error_collector: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED Server-side label Enable error collection? When enabled, the agent collects error traces from your app. ignore_status_codes Type Array of Integers Default [404] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERROR_CODES Server-side label Ignore these status codes Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to ignore. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_classes Type Array|Object Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS Comma-delimited list of javascript error types/classes for the error collector to ignore. The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { ignore_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all reference errors. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. ignore_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ ignore_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would ignore all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_status_codes Type Array of integers Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERROR_CODES Comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for the error collector to mark as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_ERRORS The following configuration /* ... */ error_collector: { expected_classes: [\"ReferenceError\"] } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all reference errors as expected. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. expected_messages Type Object Default {} A javascript object describing a list of javascript classes tied to javascript error messages for the collector to ignore. The following configuration. /* ... */ error_collector: { /* ... */ expected_messages: {\"Error\":[\"Undefined\", \"Out of time\"]} /* ... */ } /* ... */ Copy Would mark all errors of type Error, with the exact (case-sensitive) message strings of Undefined and Out of time. Caution Errors recorded using newrelic.noticeError do not obey this configuration value. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from error collection. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in error collection. Allows * as wildcard at end. max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Transaction tracer variables The agent groups your requests into transactions, which are used to: Visualize where your app spends its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Isolate other issues, such as slow database performance. This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_tracer: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_ENABLED Server-side label Enable transaction tracing? When enabled, the agent collects slow transaction traces. explain_threshold Type Integer Default 500 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Minimum query duration (in milliseconds) for a transaction to be eligible for slow queries in transaction traces. record_sql Type String (off, obfuscated, or raw) Default off Environ variable NEW_RELIC_RECORD_SQL This option affects both slow queries and record_sql for transaction traces. It can have one of three values: off, obfuscated, or raw. When set to off no slow queries will be captured, and backtraces and SQL will not be included in transaction traces. If set to raw or obfuscated, the agent sends raw or obfuscated SQL and a slow query sample to the collector. The agent may also send SQL when other criteria are met, such as when slow_sql.enabled is set. top_n Type Integer Default 20 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_TOP_N Defines the maximum number of requests eligible for transaction traces. Transactions are named based on the request, and top_n refers to the \"top n slowest transactions\" grouped by these names. The module replaces a recorded trace with a new trace only if the new trace is slower than the previous slowest trace of that name. The default value for this setting is top_n: 20, because the Transactions page also defaults to the 20 slowest transactions. The Node.js agent captures at least five different slow transactions in the first harvest cycle after start up. It will also reset and capture different transactions if no slow transactions have been captured for the last five harvest cycles. This allows you to see more information about more of your app's request paths, at the possible cost of not focusing on the absolutely slowest request for that harvest cycle. Tip To record the absolute slowest transaction over the last minute, you can set top_n: 0 or top_n: 1. However, this causes one very slow route to dominate your transaction traces. transaction_threshold Type Integer or apdex_f Default apdex_f Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRACER_THRESHOLD Server-side label Threshold Threshold of web transaction response time in seconds beyond which a transaction is eligible for transaction tracing. The default value is apdex_f; this sets the trace threshold to four times your application's Apdex T. You can also enter a specific time value in milliseconds. Example: Threshold set to apdex_f The default apdex_t is 100 milliseconds. If your transaction threshold is set to apdex_f, a \"slow\" transaction is 400 milliseconds. hide_internals Type boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIDE_INTERNALS The agent uses a small amount of CPU in order to hide internal properties that are attached to the web application. If you change this configuration to false, it may slightly decrease your agent overhead, but it could also have an impact on the performance of the agent. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction traces. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction traces. Allows * as wildcard at end. Rules variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the rules: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. name Type Strings or regular expressions Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES A comma-delimited list of rules to match incoming request URLs and name the associated New Relic transaction. Uses the format: name: [ {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'}, {pattern: 'STRING_OR_REGEX', name: 'NAME'} ], Copy Both parameters are required. For strings, you must escape control characters. You do not need to escape control characters in regular expressions. Additional attributes are ignored. Regular expressions support JavaScript-style capture groups, and names use $1-style replacement strings. Regular expressions only find the first matching result; subsequent matches are ignored. For more information, see Node.js transaction naming API. For the NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES environment variable, pass the rules as comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy ignore Type Strings or regular expressions Default Regular expression to match socket.io long-polling requests (\"^ \\ /socket \\ .io \\ /. * \\ /xhr-polling/\"). Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES Define a list of request URLs you want the agent to ignore. Specify the list as patterns, which can be strings or regular expressions. enforce_backstop Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ENFORCE_BACKSTOP Caution Do not change this setting unless you understand metric grouping issues. When enabled, the agent renames transactions that are not affected by other naming logic (such as the API, rules, or metric normalization rules) to NormalizedUri/*. If you set this to false, the agent sets transaction names to Uri/path/to/resource. Transaction events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the transaction_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends transaction events to New Relic. This event data includes transaction timing, transaction name, and any custom parameters. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 10000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10,000. The server will cap data at 10,000 per-minute. Important This configuration had different behavior in agent versions lower than 6.0.0. See max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) for agent versions 5.x or lower. max_samples_stored (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 20000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent stores if it is unable to communicate with the New Relic collector. The values from the previous harvest cycle will be merged into the next one, with this option limiting the maximum number. Make sure this number is greater than max_samples_per_minute; for example, set it to twice as much. Consider your memory overhead before increasing this value. Caution This configuration has different behavior starting with agent version 6.0.0 and a new recommended maximum. See max_samples_stored for agent versions 6.x or higher. max_samples_per_minute (DEPRECATED) Type Integer Default 10000 Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Caution This configuration has been replaced with max_samples_stored starting with version 6.0.0 of the agent. See max_samples_stored for 6.x or later agents. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent captures attributes from transaction events. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in transaction events. Allows * as wildcard at end. Browser monitoring variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. enable Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLE Server-side label Enable browser monitoring? Generate JavaScript headers for browser instrumentation. Although this defaults to true, the agent doesn't inject the browser JS code unless you have enabled browser monitoring. Even if you have enabled it and added the browser timing header, you can disable browser monitoring for your app by setting this to false. debug Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITOR_DEBUG If true, request un-minified sources from the server. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED If true, the agent sends custom attributes to browser monitoring. Caution Any header-related include/exclude rules must be in camelCase form to be filtered. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE Prefix of attributes to exclude from browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE Prefix of attributes to include in browser monitoring. Allows * as wildcard at end. Custom events variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the custom_insights_events: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. Currently there are no environment variables for custom events. enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent sends custom events recorded with recordCustomEvent() to New Relic. If this is disabled, the agent does not collect this data or send it to New Relic. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 1000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CUSTOM_INSIGHTS_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of custom events the agent collects per minute. If the number of custom events exceeds this limit, the agent collects a statistical sampling. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Slow queries variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the slow_sql: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for slow queries, but do not affect SQL nodes in transaction traces. enabled Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SLOW_SQL_ENABLED When enabled, the agent collects slow query details. max_samples Type Integer Default 10 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MAX_SQL_SAMPLES Defines the maximum number of slow queries the agent collects per minute. The agent discards additional queries after the limit is reached. Important Increasing this limit increases memory usage. Custom hostname variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the process_host: { section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior regarding the host display name in the APM UI. display_name Type String of 255 bytes or less Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME Specify a custom hostname for display in New Relic. If you do not set this field, New Relic will continue to use the default hostname found by calling os.hostname(). If you use the default hostname settings, New Relic finds the hostname through os.hostname(). If this call fails, New Relic uses the host's IP as the name. If you set ipv_preference: 4 or ipv_preference: 6, you can select the type of IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that appears in the New Relic UI. ipv_preference Type Integer (4 or 6) Default 4 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_IPV_PREFERENCE Environment variable overrides This section defines two configuration options only available with environment variables. These overrides are not used in most configurations. NEW_RELIC_HOME Path to the directory containing newrelic.js. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type String Default (none) NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE If used, this prevents the agent from reading configuration settings from newrelic.js. Default values and values from environment variables will still be set. This is available only as an environment variable. You cannot set it in your config file. Type Boolean Default False Datastore tracer variables This section defines the Node.js agent variables in the order they typically appear in the datastore_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file. These options control behavior for collecting datastore instance metrics. instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects datastore instance metrics (such as host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true When enabled, the agent collects database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. Cross application tracing (DEPRECATED) The Node.js agent variables that control cross application tracing typically appear in the cross_application_tracer section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default false When set to true, allows tracing of transactions across more than one New Relic-monitored applications. Important Cross application tracing (CAT) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future major release. For cross-service visibility, we recommend using distributed tracing, which is enabled by default as of agent version 8.3.0. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Error message redaction variables The Node.js agent variables that control error message redaction appear in the allow_raw_exception_messages section of your app's newrelic.js configuration file: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ALLOW_RAW_EXCEPTION_MESSAGES_ENABLED When false, the agent will redact the messages of captured errors. Distributed tracing Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has effects on other APM features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Requires Node.js agent version 4.7.0 or higher. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When configuring via the config file, place the following option in the distributed_tracing section. enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED Set this to true to enable distributed tracing. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing: { enabled: true } Copy exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. For example, to enable this in the config file, you would use: distributed_tracing:{ enabled: true, exclude_newrelic_header: true } Copy Span events Span data is reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report spans. Span configuration is set in the span_events stanza. Options include: enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED Turns reporting of span events on or off. attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_ENABLED This setting can be used to turn reporting of attributes on or off for spans. If attributes.enabled at the root level is false, no attributes will be sent with spans regardless on how this is set. attributes.include Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_INCLUDE If attributes are enabled for spans, all attribute keys found in this list will be attached to spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. attributes.exclude Type Array Default [] Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ATTRIBUTES_EXCLUDE All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent with spans. For more information, see the agent attribute rules. max_samples_stored Type Integer Default 2000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. We do not recommend configuring past 10k. The server will cap data at 10k per-minute. Infinite Tracing To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set distributed_tracing to enabled: true) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: configure distributed tracing. trace_observer.host Type String Default (none) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "Problem If you have encountered any of these common problems after installing your New Relic Node.js agent, try these troubleshooting tips. Solution Some common problems users encounter after installing the New Relic Node.js agent include: Not seeing data To minimize the amount of bandwidth the Node.js agent consumes, New Relic only reports data once per minute. If you add the agent to tests that take less than a minute to run, it will not have time to report data to New Relic. If you do not see transaction traces or other data after deploying the agent, this may be due to configuration, framework, or Apdex settings. Use New Relic Diagnostics to try to automatically identify the issue. Installation problems What to check Comments Main module Ensure that you have added require('newrelic'); as the first line of the app's main module. If the require is added later, the Node.js agent may not properly instrument your application. Conditional logic If you have any conditional logic in your require, move the conditional logic to your newrelic.js configuration file. Frameworks For problems with supported frameworks, make sure you are using Connect, Express, Hapi, Kraken, or Restify. There are other Node.js frameworks, but New Relic does not support all of them. Apdex For problems with your Apdex results, try adjusting your Apdex score via your Node.js agent config file (newrelic.js) or the New Relic user interface. Log files The Node.js agent writes its log to the newrelic_agent.log file in the application directory, unless you have changed the logging settings. If the agent does not send data or crashes your app, you can generate a troubleshooting log file to accompany bug reports and support requests. Missing VM metrics The agent can collect VM metrics related to garbage collection (GC), memory, and CPU. Some of these metrics require an additional native module to be installed. Here are some common problems and their solutions: Problem During installation, npm shows one of the following error messages: gyp ERR! configure error gyp ERR! stack Error: Can't find Python executable \"python\", you can set the PYTHON env variable. Copy gyp ERR! build error gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make Copy make: g++: Command not found Copy Solution Ensure that the prerequisites for the node-gyp module are installed. On Debian/Ubuntu platforms, use this command: apt-get install build-essential Copy For more information, see Node.js VM measurements.

Get an account Start agent install EU guided install Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Install the Node.js agent Important If you're using the agent in a Docker container, install the agent in each container. To install the Node.js agent: Create a New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Important If you are using Babel or a similar transpiler you can safeguard against any issues related to module load order by utilizing the Node command line option '-r' to preload the 'newrelic' module at application startup. For example, if your application's entry point is ./dist/server.js then you would use the require flag like so: node -r newrelic ./dist/server.js Copy Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent.

With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process.

From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.",

This document provides information for manually setting the environment variables to enable the PHP install script to run in silent mode. Choose an installer Two options are available when deploying New Relic via systems such as Puppet or Chef: Use Puppet to install the archives using the native package manager (rpm or dpkg). Distribute the contents of the tarball distribution and place the files in your selected location. If you install via the package systems, the package install scripts place the files. Ubuntu-based systems are an exception, where the post-install script will create symbolic links for the New Relic extension if you have the standard PHP installed. However, it makes no attempt to run newrelic-install, as that is left up to your Puppet or Chef scripts. In order to install New Relic via systems like Puppet or Chef, the newrelic-install script can be run in silent mode, and controlled via a number of environment variables. Set environment variables This is the list of environment variables you can set prior to invoking newrelic-install to control how it behaves. In addition to using these environment variables, ensure that you also define your license key and application name in your newrelic.ini file during installation. Important NR_INSTALL_SILENT determines whether the install runs in silent mode. When it is set, all information for the script must be provided via these environment variables. NR_INSTALL_SILENT Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. If set, the script will run in silent mode. This will stifle the display of most status messages and not stop for user input. When running in silent mode, all information for the script must be provided via these environment variables. When set, you must invoke the script with either the install or uninstall command line option to set the execution mode. NR_INSTALL_NOKSH Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. If set, the script will not attempt to re-exec itself with the Bourne Again Shell (bash) or Korn Shell (ksh). The script uses features not found in some traditional Bourne shell implementations, and by default tries to re-exec itself with a shell that is known to implement those features. If you know that your /bin/sh is either ksh or bash, you can prevent this re-execution by setting this variable to any value. NR_INSTALL_SHELL Type: path Default: (none) Use: Point the script to a compatible shell. The install script relies on certain features that are not present in some very old Bourne shell implementations. If you are deploying on such a system, set this variable to point to a replacement shell that the script will re-exec itself with. This variable will be ignored if NR_INSTALL_NOKSH is set. If your version of /bin/sh is really a link pre 3.x versions of Zsh, you may need to set this to a more Korn-compatible shell such as Bash. NR_INSTALL_PATH Type: colon-separated list of directories Default: (none) Use: List directories to add to $PATH. Contains a colon-separated list of directories to add to the current $PATH in which to look for PHP installations. If you have a PHP installation in a non-standard location that isn't in the $PATH at the time you invoke the script from Puppet or Chef, then you can set this variable. You can also edit the PATH directly to contain those directories. NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Type: colon-separated list of directories Default: (none) Use: List directories in which to install New Relic. Contains a colon-separated list of directories in which to install New Relic. If set, it contains the exclusive list, and any versions found on the PATH or in directories specified in NR_INSTALL_PATH will be ignored. NR_INSTALL_ARCH Type: string Default: (none) Use: Set to either x86 or x64 to override script-based detection. This will override the attempt to determine the architecture automatically. If you are running on a 64-bit system and you set this to x86, you will force the script to install the 32-bit daemon (if you are installing from tarballs) and agent. Setting it to x64 will install the 64-bit daemon and allow the script to detect whether your PHP version is 64-bit or 32-bit. You should not need to set this. It is provided for completeness. NR_INSTALL_KEY Type: string Default: (none) Use: Set to your New Relic license key on new installs. If this is a fresh installation and a new newrelic.ini file needs to be created, set this value to the license key. NR_INSTALL_INITSCRIPT Type: string Default: (none) Use: Specify the name of target startup daemon. Contains the name of the daemon startup script. Use this if you do not want to use the default name. NR_INSTALL_DAEMONPATH Type: path Default: (none) Use: Specify the full install path of the New Relic proxy daemon. Contains the full path of the New Relic proxy daemon install path. For all systems except Solaris, the default is /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. For Solaris the default is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. If you change this you may need to edit the init scripts or their configuration files. NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. Instructs the install script to copy the agent into place rather than using symbolic links. This is useful if you have extracted the agent into some location (such as the root user's home directory) that isn't accessible to the PHP process.",

Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance.

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.",

      "body": "In order to install New Relic via systems like Puppet or Chef, the newrelic-install script can be run in silent mode and controlled via a number of environment variables. This document provides information for manually setting the environment variables to enable the PHP install script to run in silent mode. Choose an installer Two options are available when deploying New Relic via systems such as Puppet or Chef: Use Puppet to install the archives using the native package manager (rpm or dpkg). Distribute the contents of the tarball distribution and place the files in your selected location. If you install via the package systems, the package install scripts place the files. Ubuntu-based systems are an exception, where the post-install script will create symbolic links for the New Relic extension if you have the standard PHP installed. However, it makes no attempt to run newrelic-install, as that is left up to your Puppet or Chef scripts. In order to install New Relic via systems like Puppet or Chef, the newrelic-install script can be run in silent mode, and controlled via a number of environment variables. Set environment variables This is the list of environment variables you can set prior to invoking newrelic-install to control how it behaves. In addition to using these environment variables, ensure that you also define your license key and application name in your newrelic.ini file during installation. Important NR_INSTALL_SILENT determines whether the install runs in silent mode. When it is set, all information for the script must be provided via these environment variables. NR_INSTALL_SILENT Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. If set, the script will run in silent mode. This will stifle the display of most status messages and not stop for user input. When running in silent mode, all information for the script must be provided via these environment variables. When set, you must invoke the script with either the install or uninstall command line option to set the execution mode. NR_INSTALL_NOKSH Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. If set, the script will not attempt to re-exec itself with the Bourne Again Shell (bash) or Korn Shell (ksh). The script uses features not found in some traditional Bourne shell implementations, and by default tries to re-exec itself with a shell that is known to implement those features. If you know that your /bin/sh is either ksh or bash, you can prevent this re-execution by setting this variable to any value. NR_INSTALL_SHELL Type: path Default: (none) Use: Point the script to a compatible shell. The install script relies on certain features that are not present in some very old Bourne shell implementations. If you are deploying on such a system, set this variable to point to a replacement shell that the script will re-exec itself with. This variable will be ignored if NR_INSTALL_NOKSH is set. If your version of /bin/sh is really a link pre 3.x versions of Zsh, you may need to set this to a more Korn-compatible shell such as Bash. NR_INSTALL_PATH Type: colon-separated list of directories Default: (none) Use: List directories to add to $PATH. Contains a colon-separated list of directories to add to the current $PATH in which to look for PHP installations. If you have a PHP installation in a non-standard location that isn't in the $PATH at the time you invoke the script from Puppet or Chef, then you can set this variable. You can also edit the PATH directly to contain those directories. NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Type: colon-separated list of directories Default: (none) Use: List directories in which to install New Relic. Contains a colon-separated list of directories in which to install New Relic. If set, it contains the exclusive list, and any versions found on the PATH or in directories specified in NR_INSTALL_PATH will be ignored. NR_INSTALL_ARCH Type: string Default: (none) Use: Set to either x86 or x64 to override script-based detection. This will override the attempt to determine the architecture automatically. If you are running on a 64-bit system and you set this to x86, you will force the script to install the 32-bit daemon (if you are installing from tarballs) and agent. Setting it to x64 will install the 64-bit daemon and allow the script to detect whether your PHP version is 64-bit or 32-bit. You should not need to set this. It is provided for completeness. NR_INSTALL_KEY Type: string Default: (none) Use: Set to your New Relic license key on new installs. If this is a fresh installation and a new newrelic.ini file needs to be created, set this value to the license key. NR_INSTALL_INITSCRIPT Type: string Default: (none) Use: Specify the name of target startup daemon. Contains the name of the daemon startup script. Use this if you do not want to use the default name. NR_INSTALL_DAEMONPATH Type: path Default: (none) Use: Specify the full install path of the New Relic proxy daemon. Contains the full path of the New Relic proxy daemon install path. For all systems except Solaris, the default is /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. For Solaris the default is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. If you change this you may need to edit the init scripts or their configuration files. NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. Instructs the install script to copy the agent into place rather than using symbolic links. This is useful if you have extracted the agent into some location (such as the root user's home directory) that isn't accessible to the PHP process.",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.",

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.",

If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented.

After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.",

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.",

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system.

You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.",

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy",

      "body": "In order to install New Relic via systems like Puppet or Chef, the newrelic-install script can be run in silent mode and controlled via a number of environment variables. This document provides information for manually setting the environment variables to enable the PHP install script to run in silent mode. Choose an installer Two options are available when deploying New Relic via systems such as Puppet or Chef: Use Puppet to install the archives using the native package manager (rpm or dpkg). Distribute the contents of the tarball distribution and place the files in your selected location. If you install via the package systems, the package install scripts place the files. Ubuntu-based systems are an exception, where the post-install script will create symbolic links for the New Relic extension if you have the standard PHP installed. However, it makes no attempt to run newrelic-install, as that is left up to your Puppet or Chef scripts. In order to install New Relic via systems like Puppet or Chef, the newrelic-install script can be run in silent mode, and controlled via a number of environment variables. Set environment variables This is the list of environment variables you can set prior to invoking newrelic-install to control how it behaves. In addition to using these environment variables, ensure that you also define your license key and application name in your newrelic.ini file during installation. Important NR_INSTALL_SILENT determines whether the install runs in silent mode. When it is set, all information for the script must be provided via these environment variables. NR_INSTALL_SILENT Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. If set, the script will run in silent mode. This will stifle the display of most status messages and not stop for user input. When running in silent mode, all information for the script must be provided via these environment variables. When set, you must invoke the script with either the install or uninstall command line option to set the execution mode. NR_INSTALL_NOKSH Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. If set, the script will not attempt to re-exec itself with the Bourne Again Shell (bash) or Korn Shell (ksh). The script uses features not found in some traditional Bourne shell implementations, and by default tries to re-exec itself with a shell that is known to implement those features. If you know that your /bin/sh is either ksh or bash, you can prevent this re-execution by setting this variable to any value. NR_INSTALL_SHELL Type: path Default: (none) Use: Point the script to a compatible shell. The install script relies on certain features that are not present in some very old Bourne shell implementations. If you are deploying on such a system, set this variable to point to a replacement shell that the script will re-exec itself with. This variable will be ignored if NR_INSTALL_NOKSH is set. If your version of /bin/sh is really a link pre 3.x versions of Zsh, you may need to set this to a more Korn-compatible shell such as Bash. NR_INSTALL_PATH Type: colon-separated list of directories Default: (none) Use: List directories to add to $PATH. Contains a colon-separated list of directories to add to the current $PATH in which to look for PHP installations. If you have a PHP installation in a non-standard location that isn't in the $PATH at the time you invoke the script from Puppet or Chef, then you can set this variable. You can also edit the PATH directly to contain those directories. NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Type: colon-separated list of directories Default: (none) Use: List directories in which to install New Relic. Contains a colon-separated list of directories in which to install New Relic. If set, it contains the exclusive list, and any versions found on the PATH or in directories specified in NR_INSTALL_PATH will be ignored. NR_INSTALL_ARCH Type: string Default: (none) Use: Set to either x86 or x64 to override script-based detection. This will override the attempt to determine the architecture automatically. If you are running on a 64-bit system and you set this to x86, you will force the script to install the 32-bit daemon (if you are installing from tarballs) and agent. Setting it to x64 will install the 64-bit daemon and allow the script to detect whether your PHP version is 64-bit or 32-bit. You should not need to set this. It is provided for completeness. NR_INSTALL_KEY Type: string Default: (none) Use: Set to your New Relic license key on new installs. If this is a fresh installation and a new newrelic.ini file needs to be created, set this value to the license key. NR_INSTALL_INITSCRIPT Type: string Default: (none) Use: Specify the name of target startup daemon. Contains the name of the daemon startup script. Use this if you do not want to use the default name. NR_INSTALL_DAEMONPATH Type: path Default: (none) Use: Specify the full install path of the New Relic proxy daemon. Contains the full path of the New Relic proxy daemon install path. For all systems except Solaris, the default is /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. For Solaris the default is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. If you change this you may need to edit the init scripts or their configuration files. NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN Type: flag Default: (none) Use: Set to any value to set flag to true. Instructs the install script to copy the agent into place rather than using symbolic links. This is useful if you have extracted the agent into some location (such as the root user's home directory) that isn't accessible to the PHP process.",

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in page view data. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

These key-value pairs can help you gain greater insight into your application and annotate the data in New Relic. Both default and custom attributes are visible in APM transaction traces, distributed traces, and error analytics; and APM and browser events. You can customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. Read on to learn about the PHP agent attributes, how to enable or disable them, and the rules the agent follows to determine which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. PHP agent attributes In addition to the default APM attributes, you can configure the following attributes in the PHP agent. See PHP agent (newrelic.ini) settings and Enabling and disabling attributes for more information. response.statusCode The response status code for a web request.

If you want to limit the destinations that you capture parameters for, see Selecting specific destinations. Configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* Copy Capture only specific request parameters To capture only specific request parameters, you can pass a list to attributes.include: Configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.user_id request.parameters.product_id Copy Disabling all attributes In this example, attributes are disabled, so the include and exclude lists will be ignored and all attributes will be filtered out.

The include and exclude lists will be ignored, and all attributes will be filtered out for this destination. Attributes are also disabled for browser monitoring by default.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

      "body": "Learn about properties to enable or disable attributes, and the rules that New Relic uses when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets attached to page view events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in page view data. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace.

If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

      "body": "Most PHP agent configuration variables can be set on a per-directory basis. This option is often used when there is a single web server serving multiple applications, and you want to adjust settings (for example, the app name) on an application-by-application basis. The process for setting per-directory values depends on the environment. This document describes the three most common environments: Apache PHP-FPM NGINX For other app naming options, see Name your PHP application. Another option: API calls If you are trying to change the name the application reports as, you can use the newrelic_set_appname() API call instead of per-directory settings. For other settings that you can modify with the API, see PHP agent API. If you do not have access to the code for your application, or if you need to isolate your applications to their own virtual hosts for other reasons, then use the following per-directory settings to override any configuration file settings. Apache per-directory settings for PHP When using the PHP module, Apache provides two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file: Edit the httpd.conf file or one of the files it includes. Use the syntax from the INI file examples when your web server serves up multiple domains. To view each of these domains separately in New Relic: For your main domain, set newrelic.appname = \"My Main Domain\" in your global INI file. Override the value for each of the virtual hosts by adding php_value entries as part of your virtual host configuration. Important Ensure you use the proper module name for your PHP install. Replace PHP_MODULE in the examples below with the name of the installed PHP5 module. This name depends on the Linux and/or PHP distribution being used. For example, common names include php5_module, mod_php5, php_module, etc. Capitalization may vary. For Apache servers, you can find the module names in one of the following ways. Each will generate a list of installed modules. From the command line, run: apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES Copy OR From within a webpage, use: <?php print_r(apache_get_modules()); ?> Copy Setting appname by domain Here is an example of separating domains, where PHP_MODULE is the name of your PHP5 module. <VirtualHost 192.168.42.43> ServerName www.myvhost1.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost1/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 1\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost 192.168.123.45> ServerName www.myvhost2.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost2/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 2\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy In the above example, newrelic.appname is set to a different value for each virtual host. For string and number values, use php_value name VALUE, where: name is the name of the INI setting to modify as listed in the PHP INI settings. VALUE is the value you want to set to for that particular virtual host. Be sure to surround string values in quotes marks \". If you want to change a boolean setting, use the syntax php_flag name VALUE, where name is the variable name as listed in the PHP INI settings, and VALUE is either on or off. To disable the New Relic agent completely for a virtual host, use a boolean flag: <VirtualHost 192.168.56.78> ServerName www.myvhost3.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost3/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_flag newrelic.enabled off </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy Edit the .htaccess file. Use the syntax from the INI file examples inside an .htaccess file. For example: php_value newrelic.appname \"My Blog App\" Copy This allows you to control settings on a per-directory basis from within the directories. In this example, your web server has its document root at /data/webroot. You also have two sub-directories for specialized applications: Your /data/webroot/blog contains a blog application. Your /data/webroot/shop contains a shopping cart application. To have all three portions of your site reported as distinct applications in the New Relic UI: Set the name of your main application in your INI file. Override that name using an .htaccess file in each of the specialized directories. Any part of your web server (for example, /data/webroot/something) that does not have a specific .htaccess file will use the global application name defined in the INI file. Important The .htaccess file must be in the top-level directory for that application. Objects in that directory, or its subdirectories, will use the value specified in the .htaccess file. For more information about using and securing .htaccess files, see the Apache HTTP server tutorial. PHP-FPM per-directory settings The FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM) is dedicated to PHP. It spawns a number of worker processes that wait for requests. It increases performance by not re-initializing the PHP engine on each invocation, allowing each process to deal with a number of requests before it recycles. For more information on PHP-FPM, see PHP-FPM's about page and FastCGI Process Manager on php.net. When using PHP-FPM, there are two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file and one special technique for NGINX: Edit the PHP-FPM pool per-directory settings Important Changing variables on a per-directory basis can be more difficult if you use PHP-FPM. You must use multiple PHP-FPM pools, one for each virtual host or unique application. A pool is a dedicated set of worker children that will only serve requests for that pool. Because it requires dedicated worker children, PHP-FPM scales poorly if you have a large number of virtual hosts or applications for which you want to set individual options. To configure PHP-FPM on a per-directory basis: Set the main application name in the INI file. Set up two pools for the two additional applications. Override the application name setting in those pools. Each pool has to have a unique connection mechanism (so you can identify which pool to use in your web server configuration file). Here is an example of php-fpm.conf: [app1] listen=/tmp/pool-app1.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 1\" [app2] listen=/tmp/pool-app2.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 2\" [app3] listen=/tmp/pool-app3.sock php_flag[newrelic.enabled] = off Copy The general format of the per-pool variable settings is php_value[name] = VALUE for string or numeric variables, or php_flag[name] = VALUE for boolean values. Always surround string values with quote marks \". Boolean values must be either on or off. Once the configuration file is set up, the web server must be instructed to use the different pools for different parts of the website. For more information, refer to the documentation for your web server. Create a .user.ini file. You can use the syntax from the INI file example for CGI/FastCGI in a .user.ini file. This is similar to a .htaccess file for Apache but is unique to PHP-FPM. The directory that PHP is executed in is scanned for a .user.ini file. More information about this feature is available in the PHP user.ini files documentation. Change the name of the app using the following steps In the root directory of the web page. Create the .user.ini file Add the setting you wish to change newrelic.appname = \"New Appname\" Save the file. By default, the .user.ini file is read every five minutes so no restart is necessary This is useful in the following scenarios: The server config doesn't work. In NGINX/PHP-FPM setup, there can be a lack of communication between FastCGI and PHP and the information from fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE newrelic.appname=\"Appname\" never reaches PHP. The .htaccess doesn't work, such as where PHP is implemented with suPHP Edit the NGINX config file. Important This section applies only to PHP 5.3.3 or higher. Here is a small fragment of an NGINX config file showing the general procedure to pass values to your FastCGI manager based on an NGINX location. location /blog { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=My Blog\"; ... } location /shop { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=Shopping Cart\"; ... } location /admin{ fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.enabled=false\"; ... } Copy Tip A better approach for NGINX may be to use API calls. The following code snippet (for PHP agent 2.7 or higher) is an example. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_set_appname (\"My App 1\"); } Copy Roll-up application names If you want to have an overall view of how the server is performing across all virtual hosts or all applications, it is convenient to be able to report to more than one application at a time. For example, report to a virtual host specific application as well as a roll-up application. To do this, set more than one application name for the newrelic.appname parameter by separating each application name with a semicolon. The primary application name is first, and the secondary application names next. You can define up to two extra application names. For example: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy This will report to two New Relic applications: \"Virtual Host 1\" and \"All Virtual Hosts\". Important This feature is only available in versions 2.4 or higher of the PHP agent.",

      "body": "Most PHP agent configuration variables can be set on a per-directory basis. This option is often used when there is a single web server serving multiple applications, and you want to adjust settings (for example, the app name) on an application-by-application basis. The process for setting per-directory values depends on the environment. This document describes the three most common environments: Apache PHP-FPM NGINX For other app naming options, see Name your PHP application. Another option: API calls If you are trying to change the name the application reports as, you can use the newrelic_set_appname() API call instead of per-directory settings. For other settings that you can modify with the API, see PHP agent API. If you do not have access to the code for your application, or if you need to isolate your applications to their own virtual hosts for other reasons, then use the following per-directory settings to override any configuration file settings. Apache per-directory settings for PHP When using the PHP module, Apache provides two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file: Edit the httpd.conf file or one of the files it includes. Use the syntax from the INI file examples when your web server serves up multiple domains. To view each of these domains separately in New Relic: For your main domain, set newrelic.appname = \"My Main Domain\" in your global INI file. Override the value for each of the virtual hosts by adding php_value entries as part of your virtual host configuration. Important Ensure you use the proper module name for your PHP install. Replace PHP_MODULE in the examples below with the name of the installed PHP5 module. This name depends on the Linux and/or PHP distribution being used. For example, common names include php5_module, mod_php5, php_module, etc. Capitalization may vary. For Apache servers, you can find the module names in one of the following ways. Each will generate a list of installed modules. From the command line, run: apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES Copy OR From within a webpage, use: <?php print_r(apache_get_modules()); ?> Copy Setting appname by domain Here is an example of separating domains, where PHP_MODULE is the name of your PHP5 module. <VirtualHost 192.168.42.43> ServerName www.myvhost1.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost1/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 1\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost 192.168.123.45> ServerName www.myvhost2.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost2/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 2\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy In the above example, newrelic.appname is set to a different value for each virtual host. For string and number values, use php_value name VALUE, where: name is the name of the INI setting to modify as listed in the PHP INI settings. VALUE is the value you want to set to for that particular virtual host. Be sure to surround string values in quotes marks \". If you want to change a boolean setting, use the syntax php_flag name VALUE, where name is the variable name as listed in the PHP INI settings, and VALUE is either on or off. To disable the New Relic agent completely for a virtual host, use a boolean flag: <VirtualHost 192.168.56.78> ServerName www.myvhost3.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost3/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_flag newrelic.enabled off </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy Edit the .htaccess file. Use the syntax from the INI file examples inside an .htaccess file. For example: php_value newrelic.appname \"My Blog App\" Copy This allows you to control settings on a per-directory basis from within the directories. In this example, your web server has its document root at /data/webroot. You also have two sub-directories for specialized applications: Your /data/webroot/blog contains a blog application. Your /data/webroot/shop contains a shopping cart application. To have all three portions of your site reported as distinct applications in the New Relic UI: Set the name of your main application in your INI file. Override that name using an .htaccess file in each of the specialized directories. Any part of your web server (for example, /data/webroot/something) that does not have a specific .htaccess file will use the global application name defined in the INI file. Important The .htaccess file must be in the top-level directory for that application. Objects in that directory, or its subdirectories, will use the value specified in the .htaccess file. For more information about using and securing .htaccess files, see the Apache HTTP server tutorial. PHP-FPM per-directory settings The FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM) is dedicated to PHP. It spawns a number of worker processes that wait for requests. It increases performance by not re-initializing the PHP engine on each invocation, allowing each process to deal with a number of requests before it recycles. For more information on PHP-FPM, see PHP-FPM's about page and FastCGI Process Manager on php.net. When using PHP-FPM, there are two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file and one special technique for NGINX: Edit the PHP-FPM pool per-directory settings Important Changing variables on a per-directory basis can be more difficult if you use PHP-FPM. You must use multiple PHP-FPM pools, one for each virtual host or unique application. A pool is a dedicated set of worker children that will only serve requests for that pool. Because it requires dedicated worker children, PHP-FPM scales poorly if you have a large number of virtual hosts or applications for which you want to set individual options. To configure PHP-FPM on a per-directory basis: Set the main application name in the INI file. Set up two pools for the two additional applications. Override the application name setting in those pools. Each pool has to have a unique connection mechanism (so you can identify which pool to use in your web server configuration file). Here is an example of php-fpm.conf: [app1] listen=/tmp/pool-app1.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 1\" [app2] listen=/tmp/pool-app2.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 2\" [app3] listen=/tmp/pool-app3.sock php_flag[newrelic.enabled] = off Copy The general format of the per-pool variable settings is php_value[name] = VALUE for string or numeric variables, or php_flag[name] = VALUE for boolean values. Always surround string values with quote marks \". Boolean values must be either on or off. Once the configuration file is set up, the web server must be instructed to use the different pools for different parts of the website. For more information, refer to the documentation for your web server. Create a .user.ini file. You can use the syntax from the INI file example for CGI/FastCGI in a .user.ini file. This is similar to a .htaccess file for Apache but is unique to PHP-FPM. The directory that PHP is executed in is scanned for a .user.ini file. More information about this feature is available in the PHP user.ini files documentation. Change the name of the app using the following steps In the root directory of the web page. Create the .user.ini file Add the setting you wish to change newrelic.appname = \"New Appname\" Save the file. By default, the .user.ini file is read every five minutes so no restart is necessary This is useful in the following scenarios: The server config doesn't work. In NGINX/PHP-FPM setup, there can be a lack of communication between FastCGI and PHP and the information from fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE newrelic.appname=\"Appname\" never reaches PHP. The .htaccess doesn't work, such as where PHP is implemented with suPHP Edit the NGINX config file. Important This section applies only to PHP 5.3.3 or higher. Here is a small fragment of an NGINX config file showing the general procedure to pass values to your FastCGI manager based on an NGINX location. location /blog { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=My Blog\"; ... } location /shop { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=Shopping Cart\"; ... } location /admin{ fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.enabled=false\"; ... } Copy Tip A better approach for NGINX may be to use API calls. The following code snippet (for PHP agent 2.7 or higher) is an example. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_set_appname (\"My App 1\"); } Copy Roll-up application names If you want to have an overall view of how the server is performing across all virtual hosts or all applications, it is convenient to be able to report to more than one application at a time. For example, report to a virtual host specific application as well as a roll-up application. To do this, set more than one application name for the newrelic.appname parameter by separating each application name with a semicolon. The primary application name is first, and the secondary application names next. You can define up to two extra application names. For example: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy This will report to two New Relic applications: \"Virtual Host 1\" and \"All Virtual Hosts\". Important This feature is only available in versions 2.4 or higher of the PHP agent.",

For a general overview of APM app naming (not PHP-specific), see Name your application. Set or change app name New Relic differentiates applications by their name. When you change the name an application reports as, New Relic creates a new application entity and breaks data continuity between the new and old entity. To change an application's name without breaking data continuity, use the UI alias-change option. Here are the ways to change your PHP application's name in New Relic: Configure newrelic.ini file using newrelic.appname: The recommended and most commonly used option. Set per-directory INI settings: Useful for when you have one web server serving multiple applications and want to have different settings or names for them. (Procedures for Apache, PHP-FPM, and NGINX in PHP-FPM are documented.) Change alias via UI: This changes only the alias in the UI, not the underlying app name being reported. (This option does not break data continuity in APM.) Change via API: An option if you have access to modify your application code, are okay with instrumenting it directly, and find the trace continuity implications of this call acceptable. Use multiple app names Important The ability to set multiple app names is only available in PHP agent versions 2.4 or higher. You can use multiple app names to aggregate data from several applications under the same name in APM (sometimes referred to as \"rolling up\" your data). For more about how multiple app names work, see Use multiple app names. For PHP, you can set up to three application names. The primary application name is first, and the second and third names are used for the more general data aggregation categories.

Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

      "body": "New Relic for PHP gives you several ways to change the application name that is reported to, and displayed in, New Relic. This document gives you an overview of those naming options. For a general overview of APM app naming (not PHP-specific), see Name your application. Set or change app name New Relic differentiates applications by their name. When you change the name an application reports as, New Relic creates a new application entity and breaks data continuity between the new and old entity. To change an application's name without breaking data continuity, use the UI alias-change option. Here are the ways to change your PHP application's name in New Relic: Configure newrelic.ini file using newrelic.appname: The recommended and most commonly used option. Set per-directory INI settings: Useful for when you have one web server serving multiple applications and want to have different settings or names for them. (Procedures for Apache, PHP-FPM, and NGINX in PHP-FPM are documented.) Change alias via UI: This changes only the alias in the UI, not the underlying app name being reported. (This option does not break data continuity in APM.) Change via API: An option if you have access to modify your application code, are okay with instrumenting it directly, and find the trace continuity implications of this call acceptable. Use multiple app names Important The ability to set multiple app names is only available in PHP agent versions 2.4 or higher. You can use multiple app names to aggregate data from several applications under the same name in APM (sometimes referred to as \"rolling up\" your data). For more about how multiple app names work, see Use multiple app names. For PHP, you can set up to three application names. The primary application name is first, and the second and third names are used for the more general data aggregation categories. PHP config file example Here is an example of setting multiple names in the newrelic.ini file: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;Virtual Hosts in Some Region;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

      "body": "Most PHP agent configuration variables can be set on a per-directory basis. This option is often used when there is a single web server serving multiple applications, and you want to adjust settings (for example, the app name) on an application-by-application basis. The process for setting per-directory values depends on the environment. This document describes the three most common environments: Apache PHP-FPM NGINX For other app naming options, see Name your PHP application. Another option: API calls If you are trying to change the name the application reports as, you can use the newrelic_set_appname() API call instead of per-directory settings. For other settings that you can modify with the API, see PHP agent API. If you do not have access to the code for your application, or if you need to isolate your applications to their own virtual hosts for other reasons, then use the following per-directory settings to override any configuration file settings. Apache per-directory settings for PHP When using the PHP module, Apache provides two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file: Edit the httpd.conf file or one of the files it includes. Use the syntax from the INI file examples when your web server serves up multiple domains. To view each of these domains separately in New Relic: For your main domain, set newrelic.appname = \"My Main Domain\" in your global INI file. Override the value for each of the virtual hosts by adding php_value entries as part of your virtual host configuration. Important Ensure you use the proper module name for your PHP install. Replace PHP_MODULE in the examples below with the name of the installed PHP5 module. This name depends on the Linux and/or PHP distribution being used. For example, common names include php5_module, mod_php5, php_module, etc. Capitalization may vary. For Apache servers, you can find the module names in one of the following ways. Each will generate a list of installed modules. From the command line, run: apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES Copy OR From within a webpage, use: <?php print_r(apache_get_modules()); ?> Copy Setting appname by domain Here is an example of separating domains, where PHP_MODULE is the name of your PHP5 module. <VirtualHost 192.168.42.43> ServerName www.myvhost1.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost1/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 1\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost 192.168.123.45> ServerName www.myvhost2.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost2/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 2\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy In the above example, newrelic.appname is set to a different value for each virtual host. For string and number values, use php_value name VALUE, where: name is the name of the INI setting to modify as listed in the PHP INI settings. VALUE is the value you want to set to for that particular virtual host. Be sure to surround string values in quotes marks \". If you want to change a boolean setting, use the syntax php_flag name VALUE, where name is the variable name as listed in the PHP INI settings, and VALUE is either on or off. To disable the New Relic agent completely for a virtual host, use a boolean flag: <VirtualHost 192.168.56.78> ServerName www.myvhost3.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost3/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_flag newrelic.enabled off </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy Edit the .htaccess file. Use the syntax from the INI file examples inside an .htaccess file. For example: php_value newrelic.appname \"My Blog App\" Copy This allows you to control settings on a per-directory basis from within the directories. In this example, your web server has its document root at /data/webroot. You also have two sub-directories for specialized applications: Your /data/webroot/blog contains a blog application. Your /data/webroot/shop contains a shopping cart application. To have all three portions of your site reported as distinct applications in the New Relic UI: Set the name of your main application in your INI file. Override that name using an .htaccess file in each of the specialized directories. Any part of your web server (for example, /data/webroot/something) that does not have a specific .htaccess file will use the global application name defined in the INI file. Important The .htaccess file must be in the top-level directory for that application. Objects in that directory, or its subdirectories, will use the value specified in the .htaccess file. For more information about using and securing .htaccess files, see the Apache HTTP server tutorial. PHP-FPM per-directory settings The FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM) is dedicated to PHP. It spawns a number of worker processes that wait for requests. It increases performance by not re-initializing the PHP engine on each invocation, allowing each process to deal with a number of requests before it recycles. For more information on PHP-FPM, see PHP-FPM's about page and FastCGI Process Manager on php.net. When using PHP-FPM, there are two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file and one special technique for NGINX: Edit the PHP-FPM pool per-directory settings Important Changing variables on a per-directory basis can be more difficult if you use PHP-FPM. You must use multiple PHP-FPM pools, one for each virtual host or unique application. A pool is a dedicated set of worker children that will only serve requests for that pool. Because it requires dedicated worker children, PHP-FPM scales poorly if you have a large number of virtual hosts or applications for which you want to set individual options. To configure PHP-FPM on a per-directory basis: Set the main application name in the INI file. Set up two pools for the two additional applications. Override the application name setting in those pools. Each pool has to have a unique connection mechanism (so you can identify which pool to use in your web server configuration file). Here is an example of php-fpm.conf: [app1] listen=/tmp/pool-app1.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 1\" [app2] listen=/tmp/pool-app2.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 2\" [app3] listen=/tmp/pool-app3.sock php_flag[newrelic.enabled] = off Copy The general format of the per-pool variable settings is php_value[name] = VALUE for string or numeric variables, or php_flag[name] = VALUE for boolean values. Always surround string values with quote marks \". Boolean values must be either on or off. Once the configuration file is set up, the web server must be instructed to use the different pools for different parts of the website. For more information, refer to the documentation for your web server. Create a .user.ini file. You can use the syntax from the INI file example for CGI/FastCGI in a .user.ini file. This is similar to a .htaccess file for Apache but is unique to PHP-FPM. The directory that PHP is executed in is scanned for a .user.ini file. More information about this feature is available in the PHP user.ini files documentation. Change the name of the app using the following steps In the root directory of the web page. Create the .user.ini file Add the setting you wish to change newrelic.appname = \"New Appname\" Save the file. By default, the .user.ini file is read every five minutes so no restart is necessary This is useful in the following scenarios: The server config doesn't work. In NGINX/PHP-FPM setup, there can be a lack of communication between FastCGI and PHP and the information from fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE newrelic.appname=\"Appname\" never reaches PHP. The .htaccess doesn't work, such as where PHP is implemented with suPHP Edit the NGINX config file. Important This section applies only to PHP 5.3.3 or higher. Here is a small fragment of an NGINX config file showing the general procedure to pass values to your FastCGI manager based on an NGINX location. location /blog { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=My Blog\"; ... } location /shop { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=Shopping Cart\"; ... } location /admin{ fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.enabled=false\"; ... } Copy Tip A better approach for NGINX may be to use API calls. The following code snippet (for PHP agent 2.7 or higher) is an example. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_set_appname (\"My App 1\"); } Copy Roll-up application names If you want to have an overall view of how the server is performing across all virtual hosts or all applications, it is convenient to be able to report to more than one application at a time. For example, report to a virtual host specific application as well as a roll-up application. To do this, set more than one application name for the newrelic.appname parameter by separating each application name with a semicolon. The primary application name is first, and the secondary application names next. You can define up to two extra application names. For example: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy This will report to two New Relic applications: \"Virtual Host 1\" and \"All Virtual Hosts\". Important This feature is only available in versions 2.4 or higher of the PHP agent.",

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "With the PHP agent, you can add browser monitoring to your pages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().",

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.",

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().",

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Examine logs for trace details You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. From the Transactions page, click on a trace to go to the Trace details page. From the trace details page, click See logs. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.",

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file.

With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.",

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().",

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.",

Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.",

As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.",

This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can get started with NerdGraph. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags APM agents APM agent configuration Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Service Levels Configure and manage Service Levels Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing model) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Server-side configuration transitions some core settings from your language agent's configuration file to the New Relic collector. Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support.

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our guided installation for an automated install, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Either way, you need a New Relic account. (It's free, forever.) Get an account Start guided install EU guided install PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent is a lightweight piece of software, designed to minimize its impact on the performance of your hosts. However, the exact load varies depending on your host's workload, particularly on the number of processes running on the host. This is because the agent collects detailed data from each individual process. As a general guideline, New Relic has collected benchmarks for some common types of hosts: Linux single-task host The agent has very low performance overhead on a classic, single-task host. For example, a server running Apache, Unicorn, or a single Java application. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of classic, single-task host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.3% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux Docker host The agent has very low performance overhead on a host running Docker, with exact usage depending on the number of Docker containers your machine hosts, and whether those processes are long- or short-lived. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Number of containers: 25 containers, about 100 long-lived processes running in containers Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of Docker host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.8% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Windows host The agent has very low performance overhead on a typical Windows host serving web apps and running the Windows/IIS stack. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t2.small: vCPUs: 1 Memory: 2.0 GB Storage: 30.0 GB Operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2 For this type of Windows host, typical usage is: CPU: 2 to 3% Resident Memory: 30 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux ARM64 host The agent has similar performance overhead on an ARM64 (Graviton 2) host on EC2 when compared with AMD64 machines. The benchmark is based on Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge vs. t4g.2xlarge instances. Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with infrastructure agent default settings: CPU: about 0.1% on ARM vs 0.13% AMD Virtual memory: about 0.75GB ARM vs 1 GB AMD Resident memory: 20MB ARM vs 22 MB AMD We are always improving the performance of the infrastructure agent. If you see unusually high agent performance overhead, get support at support.newrelic.com. Manage data To learn how to adjust how much data our infrastructure monitoring ingests and reports, see Manage infrastructure data.

You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes.

      "body": "New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. This document describes compatibility and support for .NET Core applications. See Compatibility and requirements for .NET Framework for .NET Framework applications. New Relic's .NET agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET Core ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After installation, the agent runs within the monitored process; there is not a separate process or service created by the agent. For frameworks and libraries that are not automatically instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with .NET custom instrumentation. Want to try out our .NET agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements Before you install the New Relic .NET agent on Windows or Linux, make sure your system meets these requirements: Microsoft .NET Core version The .NET agent supports .NET Core versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0 and 6.0. Table of minimum agent versions required per .NET Core version .NET Core version Minimum required .NET agent version .NET Core 2.0 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.1 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 2.2 > = 8.19.353.0 .NET Core 3.0 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET Core 3.1 > = 8.21.34.0 .NET 5.0 > = 8.35.0 .NET 6.0 > = 9.2.0 Important On Linux ARM64 platforms, the .NET agent only supports versions of .NET 5.0 or later. The agent is not compatible with .NET Core versions 1.0 or 1.1. For .NET Core 2.1 or higher applications with tiered compilation enabled, the agent will disable tiered compilation. .NET Core 2.1 support requires .NET Core runtime 2.1.3 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.401 or higher due to a bug in the .NET Core profiling API. Target framework version The .NET agent only supports applications targeting .NET Core 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, and .NET 5.0 and 6.0. You can find the target framework in your .csproj file: Supported: <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.2</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework> Copy <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> Copy Important On Linux ARM64 platforms, the .NET agent only supports target frameworks of net5.0 or later. Unsupported: <TargetFramework>net452</TargetFramework> Copy Important If you want to monitor an ASP.NET Core application targeting .NET Framework, ensure your install of the .NET agent has .NET Framework support enabled. App/web servers Ensure you use one of these app/web servers: Kestrel Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2 Kestrel with Nginx reverse proxy Kestrel with Apache reverse proxy Operating system The agent has been verified to work with the following operating systems: Operating system Supported versions Windows (32- and 64-bit Intel compatible architectures) Server 2008 R2 SP1 Server 2012 Server 2012 R2 Server 2016 Server 2019 Windows containers running on Server 2016 (NanoServer based images are not supported) Linux (64-bit Intel compatible only) All x64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET Core 2.0+/.NET 5+ runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation for the version of the runtime you are using. Linux (ARM64/aarch64 architectures) All ARM64 Linux distributions supported by the .NET 5+ runtime are supported by the .NET agent. For a full list, refer to Microsoft's documentation. Microsoft Azure For Azure-specific installation instructions, see: Install on Azure Cloud Services Install on Azure Service Fabric Install on Azure Web Apps Processor architectures The agent is available in both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x64) versions on Windows as well as both 64-bit (x64) and ARM64 (aarch64) versions on Linux. Permissions Installing and running the .NET agent requires these permissions: Component Necessary permissions Install the agent The process or user that installs the agent must have sufficient permissions to set environment variables and write access to the directory where the agent is installed. Run the agent The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which you installed the agent. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function. For applications using IIS via reverse proxy, the group IIS_IUSRS is often used. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Network requirements The agent requires your firewall to allow outgoing connections to specific networks and ports. Automatic instrumentation If your application is hosted in ASP.NET Core, the agent automatically creates and instruments transactions. The .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app is not automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use custom instrumentation. App frameworks The .NET agent automatically instruments these application frameworks: ASP.NET Core MVC 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0, 3.1, 5.0 and 6.0 (includes Web API) Datastores The .NET agent automatically instruments the performance of .NET application calls to these datastores: Datastore Instance details Notes Cosmos DB The .NET agent v9.2.0 or later automatically instruments Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos library v3.17.0 or later (v3.23.0 is the latest tested version). Microsoft SQL Server Use System.Data.SqlClient version 4.3.1 or Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. PostgresSQL Use Npgsql 4.0. Prior versions of Npgsql may also be instrumented, but duplicate and/or missing metrics are possible. MongoDB Driver version 2.3.x - 2.13.x: The .NET agent will support instrumenting pre-exising and new API methods in 2.6.x, but not new methods introduced in 2.7.x and higher. MySQL Use MySql.Data version 6.10.4 or later, or use the MySQL Connector StackExchange.Redis The .NET agent does not directly monitor datastore processes. Also, the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace does not list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collecting instance details for supported datastores is enabled by default. To request instance-level information from datastores not currently listed, get support at support.newrelic.com. External call libraries The .NET agent automatically instruments these external call libraries : Libraries Supported methods HttpClient The agent instruments these HttpClient methods: SendAsync GetAsync PostAsync PutAsync DeleteAsync GetStringAsync GetStreamAsync GetByteArrayAsync Messaging The agent automatically instruments these message systems: NServiceBus 6.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and distributed tracing. RabbitMQ 5.1.0 or higher: Puts and takes on messages and queue purge. When receiving messages using an IBasicConsumer, the EventingBasicConsumer is the only implementation that is instrumented by the .NET agent. BasicGet is instrumented, but the agent does not support distributed tracing for BasicGet. The following methods are instrumented: IModel.BasicGet IModel.BasicPublish IModel.BasicComsume IModel.QueuePurge EventingBasicConsumer.HandleBasicDeliver Unavailable features The following features are not available for the .NET agent: Memory usage on Linux due to an ongoing .NET Core issue (try using .NET performance metrics to get this information) Automatic brower monitoring script injection (API or manual instrumentation is required) The .NET agent does not support trim self-contained deployments and executables, because the compiler can potentially trim assemblies that the agent depends on. Infinite Tracing is not supported on Alpine Linux due to a GRPC compatibility issue. See this agent issue for more information. Connect the agent to other New Relic products In addition to APM, the .NET agent integrates with other New Relic products to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The browser monitoring JavaScript agent will not be injected by the .NET agent for ASP.NET core applications. However, you can inject the browser agent by using the .NET agent API or the browser agent's copy/paste method. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the .NET agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Dashboards The .NET agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

You can use our guided installation for an automated install, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Either way, you need a New Relic account. (It's free, forever.) Get an account Start guided install EU guided install PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.

Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "Some New Relic solutions require installation of an agent. The agent root directory is the main folder that holds the files for the agent. Typically, the agent root directory is the directory where the agent install process places the agent configuration file. You may need to find the agent root directory for several reasons: To customize your configuration file. To run New Relic Diagnostics. To install, update, or uninstall the agent. To troubleshoot if no data appears in the New Relic UI. Tip These strategies for finding the root directory are applicable if you followed the default install procedure. If you installed to a different directory, this information might not apply. APM agents The agent root directory depends on the agent you're using: C SDK The C SDK may not necessarily be installed in a single place, and it does not have an installation tool or script. The \"root directory\" depends on what the user does. In general, the root directory is the location of the libnewrelic.so or libnewrelic.a library file as well as the location of the libnewrelic.h file. Go agent The Go agent root directory is the root directory of your app, where you imported the go-agent package when you installed the Go agent. Java agent The Java agent root directory is called newrelic, which you created in your app server's root directory when you installed the Java agent. .NET Core 2.0 agent The location of the .NET Core 2.0 agent root directory depends on your system: System Location of the agent root directory Windows Look in the CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME environment variable for your application to find the location of the agent root directory. Linux The location of the agent root directory is /usr/local/newrelic-netcore20-agent. You can also look in the CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME environment variable for your application to find the location of the agent root directory. Docker In the root directory for your app, look for the agent root directory called NewRelic, which you created when you installed the Core 2.0 agent with Docker. .NET Framework agent The location of the .NET Framework agent root directory is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\.NET Agent. Node.js agent The Node.js agent root directory is the root directory of your app, where you copied newrelic.js when you installed the Node.js agent. PHP agent The location of the PHP agent root directory depends on how you installed the agent: Installation method Root directory location With a package manager or tar archive Use phpinfo() and look in the sections called Scan this dir for additional .ini files or Additional .ini files parsed for the location of the newrelic.ini file. This file will be in the agent root directory, which is called newrelic-php5. Tip The PHP agent root directory is called newrelic-php5 for all supported PHP versions, including PHP 7. With a configuration system, like Puppet or Chef To find all of the locations where the PHP agent was installed, check the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable for a list of agent root directories. Python agent You can install the Python agent anywhere on your host system and then supply a path to it through the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable or the newrelic.agent.initialize() API call. To find the location of the agent config file, look in the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable or the newrelic.agent.initialize() call for the path to the agent root directory. Ruby agent The location of the Ruby agent root directory depends on how you installed the agent: Installation method Root directory location With the newrelic_rpm gem The Ruby agent root directory is in the root directory of your app in a directory called config. Without the gem Look in the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH environment variable for the path to the agent root directory. If there isn't a path in that environment variable, check the following directories to find the one that contains the newrelic.yml file: config $HOME/.newrelic/ $HOME/ Mobile agent The mobile agent root directory is the root directory of your app. Infrastructure agent The location of the infrastructure agent root directory depends on your system: Infrastructure agent System Root directory location Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\ Linux, Docker, and Elastic Beanstalk /etc On-host integrations The location of the root directory for on-host integrations is /etc. Cloud integrations Because cloud integrations are not installed but are connected to our infrastructure monitoring through your cloud service provider, there is not a root directory specific to cloud integrations.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file.

(It's free, forever.) Get an account Start guided install EU guided install PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.",

Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

View the big picture of your app Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction) Get a high-level summary of your app Create architectural maps of your app Find errors and problems quickly Track key transactions Search and create customizable charts for the metric timeslice data most important to you, including any custom metrics you are sending to New Relic. Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users Track performance after a deploy Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces Examine database query traces Examine error traces View logs for your infrastructure data Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. Analyze business data Use the PHP agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP)",

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our guided installation for an automated install, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Either way, you need a New Relic account. (It's free, forever.) Get an account Start guided install EU guided install PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. View logs for your APM and infrastructure data You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With logs in context, you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your infrastructure data, such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Requirements Server-side configuration is not available for our C SDK agent or our PHP agent. Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings that can't be set . Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Configure from the UI The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM.

Configure from NerdGraph API For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph tutorial. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience.

Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks.

For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use newrelic_add_custom_parameter. As of release 4.4, calling newrelic_set_user_attributes(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); is equivalent to calling newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"user\", \"a\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"account\", \"b\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"product\", \"c\"); All three parameters are required, but they may be empty strings.

Usually used after manually ending a transaction with newrelic_end_transaction(), for example when separating tasks in a job queue manager. When instrumenting this new transaction, the agent performs the same operations as when the script first started. Parameters Parameter Description $appname string Required.

Requirements Agent version 3.0.5.95 or higher. Description Start a new transaction manually. Usually used after manually ending a transaction with newrelic_end_transaction(), for example when separating tasks in a job queue manager. When instrumenting this new transaction, the agent performs the same operations as when the script first started. Parameters Parameter Description $appname string Required. The application name to associate with data from this transaction. Uses the same format as newrelic.appname and can set multiple application names by separating each with a semicolon ;. While this option is required, you can read the app name from newrelic.ini with ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\"). $license string Optional. Defaults to the license key set in the New Relic agent's newrelic.ini file. Provide a different license key if you want the transaction to report to a different New Relic account. If set, this license will supersede all per-directory and global default licenses configured in INI files. Return values This function will return true if the transaction was successfully started. Examples Stop a transaction, then start another For task queue managers, you can use newrelic_end_transaction() and newrelic_start_transaction() together to manually separate transactions. This example uses ini_get to read the application name from the config file. function example() { ... // queuing logic if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_end_transaction(); // stop recording the current transaction newrelic_start_transaction(ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\")); // start recording a new transaction } ... // more queuing logic } Copy Start a new transaction with a new license key This example manually specifies the app name and the license key: function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_start_transaction(\"App1\", \"01234567890abcde01234567890abcde01234567890\"); } ... } Copy",

Requirements Agent version 3.0.5.95 or higher. Description Start a new transaction manually. Usually used after manually ending a transaction with newrelic_end_transaction(), for example when separating tasks in a job queue manager. When instrumenting this new transaction, the agent performs the same operations as when the script first started. Parameters Parameter Description $appname string Required. The application name to associate with data from this transaction. Uses the same format as newrelic.appname and can set multiple application names by separating each with a semicolon ;. While this option is required, you can read the app name from newrelic.ini with ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\"). $license string Optional. Defaults to the license key set in the New Relic agent's newrelic.ini file. Provide a different license key if you want the transaction to report to a different New Relic account. If set, this license will supersede all per-directory and global default licenses configured in INI files. Return values This function will return true if the transaction was successfully started. Examples Stop a transaction, then start another For task queue managers, you can use newrelic_end_transaction() and newrelic_start_transaction() together to manually separate transactions. This example uses ini_get to read the application name from the config file. function example() { ... // queuing logic if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_end_transaction(); // stop recording the current transaction newrelic_start_transaction(ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\")); // start recording a new transaction } ... // more queuing logic } Copy Start a new transaction with a new license key This example manually specifies the app name and the license key: function example() { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available newrelic_start_transaction(\"App1\", \"01234567890abcde01234567890abcde01234567890\"); } ... } Copy",

Usually used after manually ending a transaction with newrelic_end_transaction(), for example when separating tasks in a job queue manager. When instrumenting this new transaction, the agent performs the same operations as when the script first started. Parameters Parameter Description $appname string Required. The application name to associate with data from this transaction. Uses the same format as newrelic.appname and can set multiple application names by separating each with a semicolon ;. While this option is required, you can read the app name from newrelic.ini with ini_get(\"newrelic.appname\"). $license string Optional. Defaults to the license key set in the New Relic agent's newrelic.ini file. Provide a different license key if you want the transaction to report to a different New Relic account. If set, this license will supersede all per-directory and global default licenses configured in INI files. Return values This function will return true if the transaction was successfully started.
