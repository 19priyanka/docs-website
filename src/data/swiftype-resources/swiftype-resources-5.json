      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Transactions Transactions are captured as web transactions which are named based on the GraphQL operations executed. The following details are used to group unique query representations: operation type, operation name, and the deepest unique path. The raw representation of a transaction looks like the following: {operation_type}/{operation_name}/{deepest_unique_path} Using this query example: query { libraries { books { title author { name } } } } Copy The transaction on New Relic One will ultimately display similar to this: query/<anonymous>/libraries.books Details Operation type Indicates if the operation was a query or a mutation. Operation name The operation name when provided, or <anonymous>. query { libraries } would have a blank operation name because a name was not provided. A query with a name such as query GetLibraries { libraries } would use the operation name 'GetLibraries'. Deepest unique path The deepest path included in the selection set of a query where only one field was selected at each level. Since operation names may be reused, this helps further determine uniqueness of a given operation. We use the deepest unique path (instead of deepest path like prior) to avoid making arbitrary decisions in naming, which may imply or hide details of what could cause slowness for an application. For the query: query { libraries { branch booksInStock { isbn, title, author } magazinesInStock { issue, title } } } Copy We will select a deepest unique path of 'libraries' as we select multiple fields beyond that point. Any resolver executed beyond that point may contribute to the performance characteristics of the transaction. If the query were to only select one field per resolver, we select the full path as each selection set is unique. The query: query { libraries { booksInStock { title } } } Copy Will result in the deepest unique path: 'libraries.booksInStock.title'. id and __typename fields are automatically excluded from the naming decision. For example, a sub graph query: query { libraries { branch __typename id } } Copy Would result in the deepest unique path of: libraries.branch. Union types and inline fragments For Union types which utilize Inline Fragments, the transaction name will use < ... > brackets to indicate the underlying selected field for the Union query if only one result is specified in the query. For the following schema: union SearchResult = Book | Author type Book { title: String! } type Author { name: String! } type Query { search(contains: String): [SearchResult!] } Copy and the following query: query example { search(contains: \"author\") { __typename ... on Author { name } } } Copy Would result in the following transaction name: query/example/search<Author>.name However, if the query is returning both Book and Author: query example { search(contains: \"author\") { __typename ... on Author { name } ... on Book { title } } } Copy The resulting transaction name would be query/example/search Naming on error Errors validating or parsing a GraphQL request can impact transaction naming. Exceptions If an error is encountered in either the middleware or the resolver, the transaction name will simply be the name of the middleware or resolver in which the failure occured. Validation errors If a requested operation was able to parse but not able to validate, the following will be generated as the transaction name: In GraphQL2: graphql.validation.validation:validate In GraphQL3: graphql.validation.validate.validate Parsing errors If a requested operation cannot be parsed, the following will be generated as the transaction name: graphql.language.parser:parse Metrics The Python agent reports GraphQL field resolver and operation metrics to allow you to understand and analyze long term trends. Operation metrics Operation metrics are reported using the following format: GraphQL/operation/GraphQL/{operation_type}/{operation_name}/{deepest_unique_path} Operation Type: Specifies the type of operation to be executed. This will either be query, mutation, or <unknown> if the operation type cannot be determined. Operation Name: The name of the operation if provided or <anonymous>. Deepest Unique Path: The deepest path included in the selection set of a query where only one field is selected at each level. This helps further determine uniqueness of a given operation since operation names can be reused. Field resolver metrics Field resolver metrics are reported using the following format: GraphQL/resolve/GraphQL/{field_name} Resolver metrics capture the duration spent resolving a particular piece of requested GraphQL data. These can be used to find specific resolvers that may contribute to slowing down incoming queries. Spans and attributes Spans are captured for GraphQL operations, field resolutions, and additional work that occurs as part of a field resolution such as making a query to a database. Operation spans include the operation type, operation name, and deepest unique path. These represent the individual duration and attributes of a specific invocation within a transaction or trace. GraphQL/operation/GraphQL/{operation_type}/{operation_name}/{deepest_unique_path} Operation span attributes Name Description graphql.operation.type Query or mutation graphql.operation.name Name given to the operation or < anonymous > graphql.operation.query Name given to the query or < anonymous > Field resolver spans Resolver spans leverage the resolution path of the individual field to best differentiate within a given trace or transaction. For example, libraries.books might be used instead of just books. These represent the individual duration and attributes of a specific field being resolved as a part of the GraphQL operation. GraphQL/resolve/GraphQL/{path} Resolver span attributes Name Description graphql.field.name Name of the resolved field graphql.field.returnType Return type of the resolved field (for example Book!, [String]) graphql.field.parentType Type of the parent of this field (for example [Book]) graphql.field.path Full resolver path of the field (for example libraries.books)",

When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Stackato is a private PaaS solution developed by ActiveState. The Python agent can be used in conjunction with Stackato by following the steps outlined below. The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Stackato is a private PaaS solution developed by ActiveState. The Python agent can be used in conjunction with Stackato by following the steps outlined below. The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings. For more help with configuration, see Enable distributed tracing for your Go applications.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "This is a detailed guide showing how to install New Relic's Python agent for application performance monitoring. For simpler install instructions that will work for the majority of Python frameworks (including Django), see the standard installation guide. Read this advanced guide if you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more detailed information about the installation steps. Requirements Before you install the Python agent: Read and understand the compatibility and requirements. Have your New Relic account's license key. (If you don't have one already, sign up for a New Relic account.) Summary of install process Here's a summary of how to install the Python agent: Download and install the Python agent package. Create config file. Integrate the agent with your app. Restart your app. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment or use other hosting services, such as Heroku. 1. Download and install Download and install the agent package using your preferred procedure. For example: pip install (RECOMMENDED) Install the newrelic package directly from PyPi by running: pip install newrelic Copy easy_install Run: easy_install newrelic Copy We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading. Buildout install Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Manual download and install To obtain the package manually: Download the appropriate tar.gz file from our download site. Unpack the tar.gz file. In the top directory of the unpacked package, install it by running: python setup.py install Copy Tip This should be the python executable for the Python installation or virtual environment where you want to install the Python agent software. If installing into a system-wide Python installation, use the sudo command or run the command as root. 2. Create config file The config file is the primary method to customize the agent's behavior. You can also use server-side configuration or environment variables. After you install the package, the newrelic-admin script will be in the same directory as the Python executable. To create the agent config file, run this command in the Python executable's directory and include your license key: newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini Copy The generate-config command creates the newrelic.ini config file. 3. Integrate the agent You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. If you use any of the following services, follow these guidelines before continuing to the admin script procedure. uWSGI The agent can be used with uWSGI version 1.2.6 or higher. The recommended integration method (using the admin script via the command line) can be used for uWSGI, but you will need to supply certain specific command line options to the uwsgi executable. These include: Option Purpose --enable-threads By default uWSGI does not enable threading support within the Python interpreter core, so you cannot create background threads from Python code. However, the Python agent relies on being able to create background threads, so this option is required. To automatically configure uWSGI for multiple threads, use the --threads option. --single-interpreter By default uWSGI will execute Python code within a sub-interpreter of the process rather than the main Python interpreter created when Python is first initialized. This allows multiple separate Python web applications to run within one process, but keep them separated so they do not interfere with each other. Older versions of uWSGI can fail when using sub-interpreters with threading enabled. Recommendation: Use the --single-interpreter option, and restrict it to a single web application per process. mod_wsgi If you use mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. If you use mod_wsgi-express, you can run the admin script via the command line. For more information, see the New Relic mod_wsgi documentation. Tornado 6 The agent currently provides support for Tornado 6 only. For more information, see the Tornado 6 web framework documentation. WebFaction Python web applications on WebFaction typically use Apache/mod_wsgi. With mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. To run the newrelic-admin script via the command line, place the following in front of your standard app startup command: The path to the New Relic config file The newrelic-admin run-program script command For example, here are instructions for a Bourne-style shell. You may need to adjust these instructions for a different shell. If you use a Python gunicorn web server and your startup command is: gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy Then use this command: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy For more details about using the admin script, see Running the admin script from command line. If you cannot use the admin script method or don't want to, see the manual integration method. 4. Restart app and check for data When you finish the integration procedure: Restart your app server. Wait five minutes. View your app's data in APM's Summary page. If data does not appear after five minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Additional steps Here are some suggested next steps after installing the Python agent for your app: Explore your data in New Relic One and get comfortable with the standard user interface features. Learn about APM's Summary page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Change your application's name, and use other configuration options. Set up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Configure custom events and custom attributes to collect additional data from your app.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

For simpler install instructions that will work for the majority of Python frameworks (including Django), see the standard installation guide. Read this advanced guide if you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more detailed information about the installation steps. Requirements Before you install the Python agent: Read and understand the compatibility and requirements. Have your New Relic account's license key. (If you don't have one already, sign up for a New Relic account.) Summary of install process Here's a summary of how to install the Python agent: Download and install the Python agent package. Create config file. Integrate the agent with your app. Restart your app. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment or use other hosting services, such as Heroku. 1. Download and install Download and install the agent package using your preferred procedure. For example: pip install (RECOMMENDED) Install the newrelic package directly from PyPi by running: pip install newrelic Copy easy_install Run: easy_install newrelic Copy We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading. Buildout install Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Manual download and install To obtain the package manually: Download the appropriate tar.gz file from our download site. Unpack the tar.gz file. In the top directory of the unpacked package, install it by running: python setup.py install Copy Tip This should be the python executable for the Python installation or virtual environment where you want to install the Python agent software. If installing into a system-wide Python installation, use the sudo command or run the command as root. 2. Create config file The config file is the primary method to customize the agent's behavior. You can also use server-side configuration or environment variables. After you install the package, the newrelic-admin script will be in the same directory as the Python executable. To create the agent config file, run this command in the Python executable's directory and include your license key: newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini Copy The generate-config command creates the newrelic.ini config file. 3. Integrate the agent You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. If you use any of the following services, follow these guidelines before continuing to the admin script procedure. uWSGI The agent can be used with uWSGI version 1.2.6 or higher. The recommended integration method (using the admin script via the command line) can be used for uWSGI, but you will need to supply certain specific command line options to the uwsgi executable. These include: Option Purpose --enable-threads By default uWSGI does not enable threading support within the Python interpreter core, so you cannot create background threads from Python code. However, the Python agent relies on being able to create background threads, so this option is required. To automatically configure uWSGI for multiple threads, use the --threads option. --single-interpreter By default uWSGI will execute Python code within a sub-interpreter of the process rather than the main Python interpreter created when Python is first initialized. This allows multiple separate Python web applications to run within one process, but keep them separated so they do not interfere with each other. Older versions of uWSGI can fail when using sub-interpreters with threading enabled. Recommendation: Use the --single-interpreter option, and restrict it to a single web application per process. mod_wsgi If you use mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. If you use mod_wsgi-express, you can run the admin script via the command line. For more information, see the New Relic mod_wsgi documentation. Tornado 6 The agent currently provides support for Tornado 6 only. For more information, see the Tornado 6 web framework documentation. WebFaction Python web applications on WebFaction typically use Apache/mod_wsgi. With mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. To run the newrelic-admin script via the command line, place the following in front of your standard app startup command: The path to the New Relic config file The newrelic-admin run-program script command For example, here are instructions for a Bourne-style shell. You may need to adjust these instructions for a different shell. If you use a Python gunicorn web server and your startup command is: gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy Then use this command: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy For more details about using the admin script, see Running the admin script from command line. If you cannot use the admin script method or don't want to, see the manual integration method. 4. Restart app and check for data When you finish the integration procedure: Restart your app server. Wait five minutes. View your app's data in APM's Summary page. If data does not appear after five minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Additional steps Here are some suggested next steps after installing the Python agent for your app: Explore your data in New Relic One and get comfortable with the standard user interface features. Learn about APM's Summary page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Change your application's name, and use other configuration options. Set up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Configure custom events and custom attributes to collect additional data from your app.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules.

      "body": "New Relic has APM language agents for C, Go, Java, Node.js, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings.

(Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing: Configure trace observer monitoring Configure span attribute trace filter Configure random trace filter Options for older APM agents If you have older APM agents, use this section to figure out if the distributed tracing features you want are supported. Following the compatibility information is a section showing the basic configuration settings to turn on standard distributed tracing. If your older agent supports Infinite Tracing and you want to set it up, see the steps above.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "This is a detailed guide showing how to install New Relic's Python agent for application performance monitoring. For simpler install instructions that will work for the majority of Python frameworks (including Django), see the standard installation guide. Read this advanced guide if you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more detailed information about the installation steps. Requirements Before you install the Python agent: Read and understand the compatibility and requirements. Have your New Relic account's license key. (If you don't have one already, sign up for a New Relic account.) Summary of install process Here's a summary of how to install the Python agent: Download and install the Python agent package. Create config file. Integrate the agent with your app. Restart your app. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment or use other hosting services, such as Heroku. 1. Download and install Download and install the agent package using your preferred procedure. For example: pip install (RECOMMENDED) Install the newrelic package directly from PyPi by running: pip install newrelic Copy easy_install Run: easy_install newrelic Copy We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading. Buildout install Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Manual download and install To obtain the package manually: Download the appropriate tar.gz file from our download site. Unpack the tar.gz file. In the top directory of the unpacked package, install it by running: python setup.py install Copy Tip This should be the python executable for the Python installation or virtual environment where you want to install the Python agent software. If installing into a system-wide Python installation, use the sudo command or run the command as root. 2. Create config file The config file is the primary method to customize the agent's behavior. You can also use server-side configuration or environment variables. After you install the package, the newrelic-admin script will be in the same directory as the Python executable. To create the agent config file, run this command in the Python executable's directory and include your license key: newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini Copy The generate-config command creates the newrelic.ini config file. 3. Integrate the agent You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. If you use any of the following services, follow these guidelines before continuing to the admin script procedure. uWSGI The agent can be used with uWSGI version 1.2.6 or higher. The recommended integration method (using the admin script via the command line) can be used for uWSGI, but you will need to supply certain specific command line options to the uwsgi executable. These include: Option Purpose --enable-threads By default uWSGI does not enable threading support within the Python interpreter core, so you cannot create background threads from Python code. However, the Python agent relies on being able to create background threads, so this option is required. To automatically configure uWSGI for multiple threads, use the --threads option. --single-interpreter By default uWSGI will execute Python code within a sub-interpreter of the process rather than the main Python interpreter created when Python is first initialized. This allows multiple separate Python web applications to run within one process, but keep them separated so they do not interfere with each other. Older versions of uWSGI can fail when using sub-interpreters with threading enabled. Recommendation: Use the --single-interpreter option, and restrict it to a single web application per process. mod_wsgi If you use mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. If you use mod_wsgi-express, you can run the admin script via the command line. For more information, see the New Relic mod_wsgi documentation. Tornado 6 The agent currently provides support for Tornado 6 only. For more information, see the Tornado 6 web framework documentation. WebFaction Python web applications on WebFaction typically use Apache/mod_wsgi. With mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. To run the newrelic-admin script via the command line, place the following in front of your standard app startup command: The path to the New Relic config file The newrelic-admin run-program script command For example, here are instructions for a Bourne-style shell. You may need to adjust these instructions for a different shell. If you use a Python gunicorn web server and your startup command is: gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy Then use this command: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy For more details about using the admin script, see Running the admin script from command line. If you cannot use the admin script method or don't want to, see the manual integration method. 4. Restart app and check for data When you finish the integration procedure: Restart your app server. Wait five minutes. View your app's data in APM's Summary page. If data does not appear after five minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Additional steps Here are some suggested next steps after installing the Python agent for your app: Explore your data in New Relic One and get comfortable with the standard user interface features. Learn about APM's Summary page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Change your application's name, and use other configuration options. Set up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Configure custom events and custom attributes to collect additional data from your app.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to.

A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333).

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None.

If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to.

A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object).

If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None.

If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional.

Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333).

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None.

One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional.

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Each of these offers several ways to leverage the power of distributed tracing: Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): A fast way to get started Infinite Tracing: An advanced alternative to standard distributed tracing Older APM agents: Tracing options if you have older APM agents Manual instrumentation: Tips if automatic instrumentation doesn't work Tip If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics: How span sampling works explains distributed tracing options. Impacts to APM tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing. Quick start for standard distributed tracing (recommended): This is the best approach to set up standard distributed tracing if you haven't installed any New Relic APM agents for your services yet, or if you want to instrument additional services. Tip You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly create a free account. Step 1. Identify services Figure out which services you want to instrument so they each send trace data to New Relic. Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent We have installation assistants for a variety of languages to help you instrument each service. You should run the installation assistant for each service you want to instrument to ensure that each installation has a unique application name. To start the assistant, click the link for your language: New Relic APM: C New Relic APM: Golang New Relic APM: Java New Relic APM: .NET New Relic APM: Node.js New Relic APM: PHP New Relic APM: Python New Relic APM: Ruby Tip This quick-start approach with the installation assistant automatically enables distributed tracing for each service you run it on, but if you already have a New Relic APM agent that you want to participate in distributed tracing, you'll need to manually enable distributed tracing. See Options for older APM agents. Step 3. View traces After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are two ways to view your traces in the UI: View traces that include a specific service Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service: Go to one.newrelic.com. Click APM in the top menu bar. Click your service. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. View traces across accounts This option allows you to search all traces across all New Relic accounts in your organization that you have access to. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Browse data in the top menu bar, and then click Traces. Select your entity in the left pane. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the trace.id. For more help finding your traces in the UI: Understand and use the distributed tracing UI Query distributed trace data Set up Infinite Tracing (advanced option) Standard distributed tracing for APM agents (above) captures up to 10% of your traces, but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up Infinite Tracing. This alternative to standard distributed tracing is available for all APM language agents except C SDK. Tip To learn more about this feature, see Infinite Tracing. Before beginning, first ensure you meet the requirements. Step 1. Complete the instrumentation for standard distributed tracing in the quick start above The Infinite Tracing setup builds on the instrumentation step from the Quick start for standard distributed tracing. Step 2. Set up the trace observer The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in Set up trace observer. When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent. Step 3: Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Find the settings for your language agent below: C SDK Infinite tracing is not available for C SDK. Go Here's an overview of the settings. For more help with configuration, see Enable distributed tracing for your Go applications.

Manual instrumentation (If automatic instrumentation doesn't work) Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read: How distributed tracing works Troubleshoot missing data If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the calling service and the called service. The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service. Instrument the calling service To instrument the calling service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | Node.js | PHP | Python | Ruby. Important To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header). (Optional) Identify the call as an external call: C SDK Go Java .NET: n/a Node.js PHP: n/a Python Ruby Instrument the called service To instrument the called service: Ensure the version of the APM agent that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction: C SDK One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() is called, a NULL pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to create a transaction with the C SDK. Go One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.InsertDistributedTraceHeaders(h http.Header) is called, no headers are inserted. To create a transaction, see Instrument Go transactions. Java One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when Transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(Headers) is called, no headers are inserted (this API requires agent 6.4.0+). To create a transaction, see Java agent transaction-related APIs. .NET One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: CreateDistributedTracePayload() returns an empty payload. To create a transaction, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: the Node.js agent logs will report an error similar to this: No transaction found when calling Transaction.acceptDistributedTracePayload. Copy Use startWebTransaction to create a web transaction or startBackgroundTransaction to capture a non-web transaction. PHP One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() returns false. To create a transaction, see newrelic_start_transaction. Python To tell that a transaction is not in progress: when transaction = current_transaction() is run, transaction is None. Or, if result = accept_distributed_trace_payload(payload) is run, then the result is False. Use background_task to report a non-web transaction. For more on Python instrumentation, see Monitor transactions and segments. Ruby If you are using a Rack-based web framework and have enabled New Relic's Rack instrumentation, the Ruby agent will handle starting a transaction for you. For other use cases, see the add_transaction_tracer API method. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header). Invoke the call for accepting the payload: C SDK | Go | Java | .NET | PHP | Node.js | Python | Ruby.",

Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes NodeJS: nodejs12.x, nodejs14.x Python: python3.7, python3.8, python3.9 Go: provided, provided.al2 Java: java8.al2, java11 .NET Core: dotnetcore3.1 AWS has older runtimes for these languages as well, but AWS has not chosen to support the latest Lambda APIs with those older runtimes. Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility. If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.",

In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5.

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None.

If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional.

Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333).

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.record_exception(exc=None, value=None, tb=None, params={}, ignore_errors=[], application=None) Copy This API has been deprecated. Please use notice_error(). Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None.

One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

      "body": "The Python agent records runtime metrics to allow you to analyze the performance of your Python processes and interpreter. This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "The Python agent records runtime metrics to allow you to analyze the performance of your Python processes and interpreter. This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

      "body": "The Python agent records runtime metrics to allow you to analyze the performance of your Python processes and interpreter. This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Python app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Python: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Python agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use Python agent version 5.4.0 or higher for logs in context. Configure logs in context for your log handler. Python StreamHandler example Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a StreamHandler which by default writes logs to sys.stderr, but any handler can be used. For more information about configuring log handlers, see the Python.org documentation. # Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter import logging from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter # Instantiate a new log handler handler = logging.StreamHandler() # Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter() handler.setFormatter(formatter) # Get the root logger and add the handler to it root_logger = logging.getLogger() root_logger.addHandler(handler) Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Python app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Python: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Python agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use Python agent version 5.4.0 or higher for logs in context. Configure logs in context for your log handler. Python StreamHandler example Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a StreamHandler which by default writes logs to sys.stderr, but any handler can be used. For more information about configuring log handlers, see the Python.org documentation. # Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter import logging from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter # Instantiate a new log handler handler = logging.StreamHandler() # Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter() handler.setFormatter(formatter) # Get the root logger and add the handler to it root_logger = logging.getLogger() root_logger.addHandler(handler) Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Python app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Python: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Python agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use Python agent version 5.4.0 or higher for logs in context. Configure logs in context for your log handler. Python StreamHandler example Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a StreamHandler which by default writes logs to sys.stderr, but any handler can be used. For more information about configuring log handlers, see the Python.org documentation. # Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter import logging from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter # Instantiate a new log handler handler = logging.StreamHandler() # Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter() handler.setFormatter(formatter) # Get the root logger and add the handler to it root_logger = logging.getLogger() root_logger.addHandler(handler) Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI.

Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your Python app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by Python: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest Python agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use Python agent version 5.4.0 or higher for logs in context. Configure logs in context for your log handler. Python StreamHandler example Enabling logs in Python is as simple as instantiating a log formatter and adding it to your log handler. This example uses a StreamHandler which by default writes logs to sys.stderr, but any handler can be used. For more information about configuring log handlers, see the Python.org documentation. # Import the logging module and the New Relic log formatter import logging from newrelic.agent import NewRelicContextFormatter # Instantiate a new log handler handler = logging.StreamHandler() # Instantiate the log formatter and add it to the log handler formatter = NewRelicContextFormatter() handler.setFormatter(formatter) # Get the root logger and add the handler to it root_logger = logging.getLogger() root_logger.addHandler(handler) Copy To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "New Relic for Ruby allows you to selectively disable instrumentation for particular requests within your Rails or Sinatra application. Blocking all instrumentation Call newrelic_ignore with no arguments from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application to prevent instrumentation of all requests serviced by that controller or application: newrelic_ignore Copy Using newrelic_ignore prevents the agent from recording any performance data (metrics, transaction traces, events, traced errors, and so on) for the targeted transactions, and will also prevent the transactions from contributing to your overall Apdex score. Ignoring specific actions with Rails If you want to ignore only specific actions with a Rails controller, you can use the :only or :except options with newrelic_ignore. For example, to ignore only the index and show actions on the controller, use: newrelic_ignore :only => [:index, :show] Copy To ignore all actions on the controller except index: newrelic_ignore :except => [:index] Copy Ignoring specific routes with Sinatra If you want to ignore only specific routes within your Sinatra application, you can pass a Sinatra-style route definition to newrelic_ignore from within your Sinatra application. For more information, see Sinatra: Ignoring routes. Ignoring Apdex contributions If you want to prevent all actions in a controller from contributing to your Apdex score, but still want other performance data, use newrelic_ignore_apdex: newrelic_ignore_apdex Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_apdex supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Blocking browser instrumentation Using newrelic_ignore_enduser prevents the agent from automatically inserting the JavaScript used to capture browser monitoring data. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected. To prevent browser agent injection for all actions in a controller, add a call like this to the controller class: newrelic_ignore_enduser Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_enduser supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Ignoring transactions dynamically In some cases, you may want to base the decision to ignore a specific transaction on criteria only known at runtime, during the request. For scenarios like this, the declarative mechanisms explained above aren't a good fit. Starting in Ruby agent version 3.9.2, you can instead use the following family of API calls from any point within your transaction: NewRelic::Agent.ignore_transaction NewRelic::Agent.ignore_apdex NewRelic::Agent.ignore_enduser Copy These methods will have a similar results to the newrelic_ignore, newrelic_ignore_apdex, and newrelic_ignore_enduser calls, but can be called during a request instead of during the class definition. Ignoring transactions by URL with configuration You can ignore transactions by URL using the rules.ignore_url_regexes configuration setting: rules: ignore_url_regexes: [\"secret\", \"^/admin\"] Copy This configuration will only prevent Transaction events that match the set pattern from reporting. Use any of the newrelic_ignore* family of methods if you would like to prevent all data, such as trace data, from reporting from a transaction. Note that regexes do not include any type of anchoring by default. The /secret/ regex will match 'newrelic.com/secret/login' and it will also match 'newrelic.com/users/secretpanda'. The anchored admin regex will match 'newrelic.com/admin/praetorians' but it will not match 'newrelic.com/users/totally-real-admin'. If necessary you may also provide a list of regexes in a comma-separated string, allowing you to set ignore regexes with an environment variable: NEW_RELIC_RULES_IGNORE_URL_REGEXES=\"secret,^/admin\" Copy As always configuration from environment variables will override configuration in newrelic.yml. Troubleshooting The newrelic_ignore* family of methods will only work from within Rails controller classes, or Sinatra applications (subclasses of Sinatra::Base). Other applications should use the NewRelic::Agent.ignore_* family of calls from within each request that you would like to ignore, which will work in any context. If you get a NoMethodError when trying to use newrelic_ignore from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application, make sure that newrelic_rpm has been required before you try to call newrelic_ignore inside of your class definition.

      "body": "This document details how to instrument third-party gems with the Ruby agent, as well as some best practices for interacting with the agent. This is useful if you are using a gem that the Ruby agent does not instrument by default, or if you are a gem author who wants to add instrumentation for your library. Contents Finding third-party extensions Anyone can write a gem that builds on top of the Ruby agent. New Relic maintains a repository called extends_newrelic_rpm to track these extensions and to provide links to other gems that build the Ruby agent. These extensions are not supported by New Relic. New Relic gathers these links as a service to our customers. Issues with those gems should be reported to the respective projects on GitHub. Extensions as gems New Relic encourages third-party extensions to be maintained as gems, with one gem per instrumented library. For example, newrelic-redis provides instrumentation for the redis gem. Starting transactions If your library provides code which should be represented as a full transaction in New Relic (for example: a web request or background job that isn't instrumented by the Ruby agent), then use one of these mechanisms for starting a transaction. add_transaction_tracer The simplest way to get a transaction started is to call add_transaction_tracer on the method. This assumes that NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation is included in your class. class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction # execute a transaction end add_transaction_tracer :transaction end Copy perform_action_with_newrelic_trace Sometimes you need slightly more control over the transaction that New Relic generates. When that happens, you can use perform_action_with_newrelic_trace. Some of the parameters you can override include the transaction name and category (whether it's a web transaction or a background transaction). class CustomBackgroundJob include NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation def transaction perform_action_with_newrelic_trace(:name => \"custom_name\", :category => :task) do # your work here... end end end Copy See the full documentation of perform_action_with_newrelic_trace for further information on parameters and usage. Nodes in transaction traces You may want to add timing information to New Relic about calls to a method, but it does not represent a full transaction. New Relic recommends adding a method tracer to accomplish this. add_method_tracer require 'new_relic/agent/method_tracer' class Foo include ::NewRelic::Agent::MethodTracer def generate_image # ... end add_method_tracer :generate_image, 'Custom/generate_image' end Copy The above example results in metrics being recorded for the name 'Custom/generate_image', as well as an entry in transaction traces that includes the method call. Custom Datastores The Ruby agent provides special functionality for recording calls to Datastores. These are intended to support both SQL and NoSQL databases, and provide a consistent interface for use by third-party gems. Metrics recorded via the NewRelic::Agent::Datastores module functions will show up in the Databases UI in New Relic. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace trace is the simplest way to record Datastore for a method. class FauxDB def find # FauxDB lookup end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.trace self, :find, \"FauxDB\" end Copy The first parameter is the class to instrument, the second the method to find, the third the datastore product name. An optional operation name can be included as the final parameter, otherwise the method name is used to represent the operation in metrics. Note that Datastore metrics recorded with this interface do not allow for adding a collection/table name. For that, see the wrap method below. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap wrap allows for recording Datastore metrics with additional collection/table information in the metric names. It also provides a callback for operations such as noticing slow statements. class FauxDB def find(table) NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", table) do # FauxDB lookup end end end Copy If you want to record additional information about your datastore call, you can use the optional callback parameter on wrap: class FauxDB def find(query) callback = Proc.new do |result, scoped_metric, elapsed| NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) end NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.wrap(\"FauxDB\", \"find\", \"items\", callback) do # execute query end end end Copy NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql This helper method records slow SQL queries for presentation in transaction traces and slow SQL pages. SQL is filtered and obfuscated based on the user's settings. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_sql(query, scoped_metric, elapsed) Copy Non-SQL queries should never be sent through notice_sql.Use notice_statement instead. Caution New Relic's Transaction Tracing and Slow SQL features will attempt to apply obfuscation to the passed queries, but it is possible for a query format to be unsupported and result in exposing user information embedded within captured queries. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement This helper method records statements for slow datastore calls to transaction traces. These are not obfuscated. NewRelic::Agent::Datastores.notice_statement(statement, elapsed) Copy SQL queries should never be sent through notice_statement. Use notice_sql instead. Caution This method will properly ignore statements when the user has turned off capturing queries, but it is not able to obfuscate arbitrary data! Ensure all data passed to this method is safe to transmit to New Relic in order to prevent exposing user information embedded in captured queries. Testing your extension You can write automated tests when you author a gem that extends New Relic. The test helpers used by the agent itself are available to simplify some common testing tasks. NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper The test methods documented in this section can be accessed by calling this from your test code (most commonly a test_helper.rb file) NewRelic::Agent.require_test_helper Copy assert_metrics_recorded This method is the primary way to ensure your expected metrics are recorded by the Ruby agent. refute_metrics_recorded is also available. In the simplest form, assert_metrics_recorded can be called like this: assert_metrics_recorded([\"MetricA\", \"MetricB\"]) Copy Metrics with specific values can be asserted via this syntax: assert_metrics_recorded('MetricA' => { :call_count => 1, :total_call_time => 1.0 }) Copy in_web_transaction/in_background_transaction These methods simulate running in web or background transaction. in_web_transaction do # Perform work to test behavior in transaction end Copy with_config Configuration of the agent can be changed for testing via with_config. It takes a hash which is applied to the other configuration values in agent. with_config(:enabled => false) do # Check what happens when agent's disabled end Copy Tip This method doesn't help for testing installation of instrumentation, as those config values are typically checked when instrumentation happens on require, and isn't influenced by the setting change in a test. Multiverse: Test against multiple gem versions If you need to test your extension against multiple gem versions, you can use Multiverse, a part of the Ruby agent's own testing code. For examples of Multiverse testing, see the suites directory in the agent files. To configure Multiverse for your own gem: Require tasks/multiverse in Rakefile. To enable the rake test:multiverse command, add the following to your Rakefile: require \"tasks/multiverse\" Copy Create the Multiverse test directory. Multiverse tests require a specific file layout. Create a directory named test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT with the following file locations: test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/Envfile test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/config/newrelic.yml test/multiverse/YOUR_PROJECT/FILE_WITH_A_TEST.rb Copy Configure your Envfile. Use the Envfile to declare sets of gem dependencies for your Multiverse tests. For example, your Envfile might look like this: gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 1.0.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB gemfile <-RB gem 'your-project', '~> 2.1.0' gem 'rack' gem 'newrelic_rpm' gem 'newrelic_your-project', path: '../../..' RB Copy Tip Include the gem lines for newrelic_rpm and rack to ensure your Multiverse tests work. Detect dependencies. If necessary, ensure your extension's instrumentation is loaded by running an additional dependency detection from your Multiverse tests: require 'newrelic/your-project' DependencyDetection.detect! class YourProjectTest > Minitest::Test end Copy To run your Multiverse tests against the gem dependencies in your Envfile: After setting up Multiverse for your gem, run rake test:multiverse to execute the tests in your directory.",
