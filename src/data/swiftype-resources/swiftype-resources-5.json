      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

Distributed Tracing gives software teams working in modern environments an easy way to capture, visualize, and analyze traces through complex architectures, including architectures that use both monoliths and microservices. What’s the impact? With this change, customers will see distributed traces immediately upon upgrading to Python version v7.0.0.166. Distributed Tracing on by default provides more data and better visibility for cross-application requests. If you do not need this feature, it can be turned off in the Python agent configuration file by setting distributed_tracing.enabled=false OR by setting the environment variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=false. If you need more traces and are experiencing dropped spans, the agent reservoir can be expanded to accommodate more spans. To do so, set environment variable or config item called span_events.max_samples_stored to a value greater than 2,000 up to a maximum value of 10,000. Note that increasing this value may impact memory usage. With Distributed Tracing on by default, Cross Application Tracing (CAT) will now be deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the agent. Customers on CAT will now see distributed traces instead. Customers who would like to revert back to CAT can do so in the configuration file by setting cross_application_tracer.enabled = true. It is however recommended to stay using distributed tracing, given that CAT will be removed in the future.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

New Relic normally produces complete information automatically, without any need to modify your application code. However, if you are not using a supported framework, you may need to add custom instrumentation. Custom instrumentation is also useful to: Add detail to your transaction traces. Block instrumentation on selected transactions you do not want instrumented. Instrument a part of your code that New Relic simply is not picking up. Custom instrumentation that creates a new transaction collects both metric timeslice and event data. Custom instrumentation for already instrumented transactions collects only metric timeslice data. Important Do not use brackets [suffix] at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses (suffix) or other symbols if needed. When to use custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to track interactions that are not captured by New Relic's automatic instrumentation. Custom instrumentation can also add detail to your transaction traces, to help you identify key issues. New Relic collects data from many frameworks automatically. If you are using a supported framework, you should not need custom instrumentation to collect metric timeslices, events, and traces. However, if you encounter any of these situations, you may need custom instrumentation: Transactions do not appear in the UI. Transaction traces include large blocks of application code time without full detail. If you are using a supported framework, but are not seeing transaction on the APM Transactions page, get support at support.newrelic.com to ensure the framework instrumentation is working. Implement custom instrumentation Each agent implements custom instrumentation differently: C SDK custom instrumentation For applications monitored by the C SDK, you must manually instrument transactions, segments, and errors. For more information, see the C SDK instrumentation procedures. Go custom instrumentation Because Golang apps run from a compiled, native binary file, all New Relic instrumentation must be done manually. See Instrument Go transactions and Instrument Go segments for how to set up instrumentation in your Go app. Java custom instrumentation New Relic's Java agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Annotation: Add @Trace annotations to your code to ensure New Relic instruments specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, if you are instrumenting only a few methods. For more complex instrumentation, or if you are unable to modify your code, use XML. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to monitor in an XML file. XML instrumentation is flexible and doesn't require editing your code, but is more difficult to troubleshoot than annotation. For more information, see Java custom instrumentation. .NET custom instrumentation New Relic's .NET agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Attributes: Annotate your code with agent API calls to instrument specific methods. Annotation is easy to implement, but requires editing your source code. XML: Define the methods you want New Relic to instrument in an XML file. XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule.

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",

XML instrumentation does not require modifying your source code, but is more complicated to create and keep updated than attribute instrumentation. For more information, see Introduction to .NET custom instrumentation. Node.js custom instrumentation New Relic's Node.js agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see Node.js custom instrumentation. PHP custom instrumentation New Relic's PHP agent uses API calls for custom instrumentation. For more information, see PHP custom instrumentation. Python custom instrumentation New Relic's Python agent supports two methods of custom instrumentation: Configuration file: Use the agent configuration file to specify the functions and methods you want instrumented. The agent configuration file is easy to set up, and it does not require you to modify your code. However, it is less flexible than API calls. API calls: Edit your code to call the New Relic Python API. The API is more flexible than instrumentation via the configuration file, but it requires you to modify your code. For more information, see Python custom instrumentation. Ruby custom instrumentation New Relic's Ruby agent uses API calls to define target methods and add transaction tracers to them. For more information, see Ruby custom instrumentation. Grouping issues A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently-named metric timeslices to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. Custom instrumentation can cause metric grouping issues if you introduce too many uniquely-named metric timeslices that New Relic cannot effectively group. If you send thousands of metrics, New Relic may apply rules to reduce the number of transactions.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 18 October 2022 April-October 2022 16 October 2021 July 26, 2021 with Node.js agent v8.0.0 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 26, 2021, we have discontinued support for Node.js 10 with v8 of the Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021. This includes the Oracle Driver Package and Hapi versions prior to Hapi 19.2 for our Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent can add the benefits of browser monitoring when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent. Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 18 October 2022 April-October 2022 16 October 2021 July 26, 2021 with Node.js agent v8.0.0 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 26, 2021, we have discontinued support for Node.js 10 with v8 of the Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021. This includes the Oracle Driver Package and Hapi versions prior to Hapi 19.2 for our Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent can add the benefits of browser monitoring when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent. Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches.

For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. EOL NOTICE We're discontinuing support for several capabilities in November 2021. This includes the Oracle Driver Package and Hapi versions prior to Hapi 19.2 for our Node.js agent. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent can add the benefits of browser monitoring when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent. Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment.

New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you observability across your entire stack: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent can add the benefits of browser monitoring when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent. Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Stackato is a private PaaS solution developed by ActiveState. The Python agent can be used in conjunction with Stackato by following the steps outlined below. The instructions here require you to use version 0.6 or higher of the Stackato VM image. If you use an older version of the Stackato VM image you will need to upgrade. Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

Contents Package installation ActiveState hosts a copy of the Python agent package in their PyPM package repository. To install the Python package for the agent, add newrelic into the requirements.txt file on a line by itself: newrelic Copy You would then perform the update command using the Stackato client. The PyPM package repository updates daily. If you need to use a newer version of the Python agent than is available from the PyPM package repository, you will instead need to fallback to using pip and source packages from PyPI. In this case you will need to create in addition to the requirements.txt file used by PyPM, a requirements.pip file as input for pip. In the requirements.pip file you should list the newrelic package. Agent configuration file You will need to generate the Python agent configuration on your local system as described in Python agent installation and add that to the directory you push to your Stackato instance. The option in the agent configuration file for specifying where the agent log file output should go, should be set to: log_file = stderr Copy Python agent initialization Although you can manually include code for initializing the Python agent into the Python module containing your WSGI application entry point, as per instructions for integration with your Python application, a simplified startup method is also available by using the newrelic-admin script. In the case where you do it manually, such changes would typically be made to the wsgi.py file which includes your Python web application. Since the agent configuration file would be in the same directory, the change to the wsgi.py file would be to add: import newrelic.agent config_file = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Because the directory in the filesystem where the application is installed can change, the location of the agent configuration is calculated relative to the location of the wsgi.py file automatically. The alternative to adding code to perform initialization of the agent manually is to use the newrelic-admin script. If you are explicitly defining in the stackato.yml file how to startup your web application by setting the web entry in the processes section: processes: web: python app.py Copy You would replace web so it reads: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program python app.py Copy In other words, you are prefixing the existing command with newrelic-admin run-program. At the same time, you should also add an env section to the stackato.yml file with: env: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE: newrelic.ini Copy If you aren't overriding the web entry already and instead are relying on the default of the Stackato stack running uWSGI for you the process is a bit different. In this case you will need to add a web entry to stackato.yml as: processes: web: newrelic-admin run-program $PROCESSES_WEB Copy The env section is also again required. If PROCESSES_WEB is not defined and this does not work it indicates you are using an older VM image and should upgrade. Whether the manual or more automated method is used, if necessary for the Python web framework being used, the WSGI application entry point object will also need to be wrapped appropriately.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages, including Python. With the agent, you can extend Heroku with metrics from New Relic One. This document describes special considerations for using Heroku as a hosting service with Python agent. Contents Install the New Relic add-on After deploying your Python app on Heroku, install the Python agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website, you must be logged in to Heroku: From Heroku's Add-on page for New Relic, select a subscription plan. From Select an app, select your New Relic app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the Python agent add-on with Heroku the toolbelt: Run the following command, where $planlevel is the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:$planlevel Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Restart your dyno. Generate some traffic to your app. Installing the add-on automatically creates a private New Relic account and configures access for Heroku hosts. The agent will begin monitoring application performance, end user experience, and host performance collected after the add-on is installed. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. Upgrade from an existing agent installation If an agent is already installed, reinstall the add-on using the Heroku toolbelt command. heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Your Application Name' Copy Install the Python agent To install a third party Python package such as our Python agent on Heroku, use pip. Heroku automatically looks for a requirements.txt file in the root directory of your project. It installs anything listed in that file when you push your project to Heroku. Create or edit the requirements.txt file, adding the line: newrelic Copy Django users: Modify the web entry of your Procfile, prefixing the value with newrelic-admin run-program. For example: web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn mysite.wsgi Copy Push your project up to Heroku. This will install the the Python agent package with the latest version listed on the Python Package Index (PyPi). Update the Python agent Heroku caches packages and does not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade: Edit the requirements.txt file by including the specific Python agent version (n.n.n.n) with the package name: newrelic==n.n.n.n Copy Push your project up to Heroku. Verify the New Relic add-on To verify that the New Relic add-on has been enabled, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This generates a list of New Relic-specific environment variables in Heroku. The Python agent uses these to determine which New Relic account and application data to use for reporting data. At a minimum, you should see: NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Your app name Copy The license key is unique to your New Relic account. Troubleshoot your installation Within a few minutes of installing and configuring the agent, data should start appearing in your app's APM Summary page. If no data appears, test that environment variables are being detected properly by running: heroku run newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test. Capture the output from running the test, and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, follow the Python agent troubleshooting procedures. Initialize the Python agent To initialize the Python agent: From the root of your project, find the Procfile. Modify the web entry in your Procfile to define what to do to start up your Python web application. Refer to the following examples to insert newrelic-admin run-program at the start of the command. Run your Python web application under the control of the the Python agent's admin script. Hosting mechanism Example web entry Flask with the built-in development host web: newrelic-admin run-program python hello.py Copy Flask with gunicorn web: newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 hello:app Copy Django with gunicorn listed in INSTALLED_APPS web: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py run_gunicorn -b \"0.0.0.0:$PORT\" -w 3 Copy Caution Avoid using the built-in development hosts of any web framework prior to Python version 2.7.4 or prior to Django 1.4. Instead, use gunicorn or uWSGI. The WSGI host using the wsgiref module was not fully WSGI compliant for development hosts prior to Python version 2.7.4. This prevented the Python agent from being able to report correct data. WSGI application wrapping The agent provides automatic wrapping of the the WSGI application point for these web frameworks: Bottle Django Flask If you are using any of these Python web frameworks, no additional steps are required. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. If the entry point is this... Do this... Entry point is a function Wrap it in a decorator: import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Entry point is a function or object imported from a different module Wrap it in pre decorator style: import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Track Celery tasks To record execution time for Celery tasks as background tasks against your web application, wrap the startup of the Celery host with the newrelic-admin command. Prefix the existing startup command defined by the worker entry in your Procfile: worker: newrelic-admin run-program python hellodjango/manage.py celeryd -E -B --loglevel=INFO Copy Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. Heroku sends Python agent output to standard output and captures it in the web server log. To get access to the web server log for Heroku, run: heroku logs Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If New Relic Support requests an alternate level of logging, you must manually add a config variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug Copy Your application automatically restarts when you change the log level. Caution The debug log level produces large quantities of output. Be sure to remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required, by running: heroku config:remove NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy Edit the agent configuration file When using Heroku's add-on with New Relic, this automatically sets key environment variables for the Python agent. You can also customize additional settings with the agent configuration file, or use server-side configuration. Do not add core settings such as the license key, application name, etc. to the configuration file. Heroku automatically adds these settings. To customize other settings, use the Python agent configuration file with Heroku: Add the newrelic.ini agent configuration file to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to Heroku: In the [newrelic] section, include the specific configuration setting; for example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository, and push the change up to Heroku. Use the heroku config:add command to set the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE environment variable for your deployed application: heroku config:add NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy If you are using the newrelic-admin wrapper program to launch your WSGI host, the settings for your license key, application name, etc., will be picked up from the environment variables set by Heroku. Any additional settings you set in the agent configuration file will also be applied. Then, when the agent registers with New Relic, any server-side configuration will also be merged to create the final configuration the agent will use.

      "body": "OpenShift is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution capable of hosting web applications using various languages, including the Python agent. Prepare your application Before installing the Python agent, make sure your Python web application is installed and running under OpenShift using one of the available Python cartridges. See the OpenShift developer guides for more information. Install the APM Python agent OpenShift support two different ways of installing third party Python packages. You can either list the package as a dependency in the setup.py for your web application, or in the requirements.txt file used by pip. If you are using a setup.py file, install the agent by adding newrelic to the list of third party modules passed to install_requires: from setuptools import setup setup(name='YourAppName', version='1.0', description='OpenShift App', author='Your Name', author_email='example@example.com', url='https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/distutils-sig', install_requires=['Flask>=0.7.2', 'MarkupSafe', 'newrelic'], ) Copy If you are using pip, add the following line to requirements.txt: newrelic Copy When you push your project up to OpenShift, this will install the Python agent package. It will use the latest version of the Python agent from the OpenShift mirror of the Python Package Index (PyPi). Updates to the OpenShift mirror of PyPi can be delayed, so you may have to wait up to a day before a new release on PyPi is available on OpenShift. Update the Python agent OpenShift will cache packages and will not detect when a newer version of the Python agent is available. To force an upgrade to a newer version, explicitly list the version against the package name in the setup.py or requirements.txt file and push your application. Use this syntax: newrelic==A.B.C.D Copy Replace A.B.C.D with the version of the the Python agent you wish to install. Use Python agent environment variables In order for the Python agent to report data to the correct account, you need to tell it the license key for your New Relic account. For OpenShift, the most secure way to provide the license key is using an environment variable configured in your application configuration using the rhc env set command. This avoids storing sensitive information in your GIT repository and also works if you are using a scaled web application which is hosted on multiple physical hosts. rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy While specifying your license key, also tell the Python agent where to record log messages: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG=stderr -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To verify that the environment variables are being set, run: rhc env list -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Although set, these will only take effect the next time the web application gears are restarted. Test the agent installation To test that the Python agent package has been installed correctly and that the agent environment variables are being set correctly, you can ssh into the main gear of your application and run: newrelic-admin validate-config - stdout Copy This admin script will create a connection and report test transaction data under the application Python Agent Test in your account. Data can take up to five minutes to appear in the UI. If it doesn't appear after some time, capture the output from running the test and use the data to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Initialize the Python agent The OpenShift Python cartridges provide two ways of running a WSGI application. The first method uses a preconfigured Apache/mod_wsgi installation. In this case your WSGI application entry point must be defined in the wsgi.py file. The second method relies on you to provide a standalone Python web application script called app.py. This will typically start an embedded Python WSGI server, with the WSGI application entry point being specified within the app.py file, or be imported from a separate Python code file, such as the wsgi.py file. For either method, OpenShift controls the startup of the WSGI server. You must manually integrate the Python agent into your WSGI application. You cannot use the newrelic-admin wrapper script around the startup of the WSGI server. If you are using the Apache/mod_wsgi approach, add the following code at the very start of the wsgi.py file: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() Copy Make sure this precedes any other Python module imports appearing in the wsgi.py file. You do not need to provide any arguments to the initialize() call, because the license key information and destination for logging are read from the environment variables. If you are using an embedded Python WSGI server from app.py, place these lines at the very top of the app.py file, even if you import the WSGI application entry point from a wsgi.py file. When using app.py with wsgi.py, do not add these lines to wsgi.py. Avoid using the built-in development servers of any web framework. Also, do not use the OpenShift Python 2.6 cartridge or older Django versions. This is because these development servers are often based on the WSGI server from the wsgiref module from the Python standard library. The WSGI server from the wsgiref module had a bug, which meant it was not fully WSGI-compliant, and this would cause the Python agent to report incorrect data. This issue with the wsgiref module is only fixed in Python 2.7.4. The built-in WSGI server in older versions of Django prior to Django 1.4 had a similar problem. Wrap the WSGI application If you are using a Python web framework for which the agent provides automatic wrapping of the WSGI application entry point, this is all that needs to be done. Python web frameworks with automatic wrapping include Django, Flask, and Bottle. For others, you must modify the Python code file with your WSGI application entry point to wrap the WSGI application object with a WSGI application wrapper. This will initiate the timing for the web requests received by your application. Entry point Example code Enty point is a function Wrap it in a decorator. import newrelic.agent @newrelic.agent.wsgi_application() def application(environ, start_response): ... Copy Enty point is a function or object imported from a different module. Wrap it in pre decorator style. import myapp application = myapp.WSGIHandler() application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application) Copy Override the application name By default, your data is recorded under the app name Python Application. To change the display name, use the APM user interface. However, from the agent side, we highly recommends keeping this as a unique, unchanging value, independent of changes to the display name in the UI. This is required if you intend to run multiple distinct sites under the one New Relic account and want to have the data reported separately. To override the application name, use the rhc env set command: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='Web Site (Production)' -a yourappname Copy To verify that the configuration has been updated, run: rhc env list -a yourappname Copy Then look for: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Web Site (Production) Copy Changes to environment variables only take effect the next time you restart your web application gears. Debug the Python agent To begin debugging, collect the log output from the Python agent. When the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable is set to stderr, the log messages from the Python agent will be captured within the standard Python web application logs. To tail the web application logs under OpenShift, run: rhc tail -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy To get the complete log, copy back from each of your web applications the log file: $OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_LOG_DIR/python.log Copy By default the Python agent will log at info level. If the agent requires an alternate level of logging, you will need to manually add an additional environment variable. For example, to set logging output to debug, run: rhc env set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Environment variables do not take effect immediately, so be sure to restart your web application gears. Run debug logging only when requested and only for the time required. Debug logging can produce a lot of output and will bloat your log files. Remove this setting as soon as it is no longer required by running the following command, and then restart your web application gears: rhc env unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL -a YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Use the logfile to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com Update agent configuration file With OpenShift, the preferred way of specifying your account license key and defining where logging should go is to use environment variables. This means it is not necessary to use an agent configuration file to get the agent working. However, without the agent configuration file, it is not possible to customize other agent settings. If you enable server-side configuration for your application, you do not need an agent configuration file. This is done from the Application settings in the APM user interface application. Using server-side configuration you can override core settings for the agent. When a change is made to a setting via the UI, the agent running within each of your web application processes will be notified, and it will pick up the changed settings. However, some agent features are incompatible with server-side configuration. In these cases, use an agent configuration file pushed up with your web application to OpenShift. To add and enable an agent configuration file with OpenShift: Add the agent configuration file newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository that you are pushing up to OpenShift. This should contain a [newrelic] section along with just the specific configuration setting you need to set. For example: [newrelic] transaction_tracer.function_trace = mydbm:connect Copy Do not use the agent configuration file for core settings such as the license key or app name, as doing so will override the environment variable settings. You also likely do not want the license key as part of your GIT repository, especially if the project source code is publicly available. Also note that if server-side configuration is enabled at the same time, any setting that can be set via server-side configuration will always override the local setting. Therefore only use this for settings that cannot be set using server-side configuration if server-side configuration is enabled. Now modify the wsgi.py or app.py file where you added the code to initialize the Python agent. Change the code you had already added to: import os import newrelic.agent repo_dir = os.environ['OPENSHIFT_REPO_DIR'] config_file = os.path.join(repo_dir, 'newrelic.ini') newrelic.agent.initialize(config_file) Copy Commit the configuration file to your repository and push the change up to OpenShift.

Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges.

This update eliminates the need to configure the agent in order to have access to distributed traces. Distributed Tracing gives software teams working in modern environments an easy way to capture, visualize, and analyze traces through complex architectures, including architectures that use both monoliths and microservices. What’s the impact? With this change, customers will see distributed traces immediately upon upgrading to Python version v7.0.0.166. Distributed Tracing on by default provides more data and better visibility for cross-application requests. If you do not need this feature, it can be turned off in the Python agent configuration file by setting distributed_tracing.enabled=false OR by setting the environment variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=false. If you need more traces and are experiencing dropped spans, the agent reservoir can be expanded to accommodate more spans. To do so, set environment variable or config item called span_events.max_samples_stored to a value greater than 2,000 up to a maximum value of 10,000. Note that increasing this value may impact memory usage. With Distributed Tracing on by default, Cross Application Tracing (CAT) will now be deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the agent. Customers on CAT will now see distributed traces instead. Customers who would like to revert back to CAT can do so in the configuration file by setting cross_application_tracer.enabled = true. It is however recommended to stay using distributed tracing, given that CAT will be removed in the future.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

For simpler install instructions that will work for the majority of Python frameworks (including Django), see the standard installation guide. Read this advanced guide if you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more detailed information about the installation steps. Requirements Before you install the Python agent: Read and understand the compatibility and requirements. Have your New Relic account's license key. (If you don't have one already, sign up for a New Relic account.) Summary of install process Here's a summary of how to install the Python agent: Download and install the Python agent package. Create config file. Integrate the agent with your app. Restart your app. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment or use other hosting services, such as Heroku. 1. Download and install Download and install the agent package using your preferred procedure. For example: pip install (RECOMMENDED) Install the newrelic package directly from PyPi by running: pip install newrelic Copy easy_install Run: easy_install newrelic Copy We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading. Buildout install Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the newrelic package using the zc.recipe.egg recipe. Manual download and install To obtain the package manually: Download the appropriate tar.gz file from our download site. Unpack the tar.gz file. In the top directory of the unpacked package, install it by running: python setup.py install Copy Tip This should be the python executable for the Python installation or virtual environment where you want to install the Python agent software. If installing into a system-wide Python installation, use the sudo command or run the command as root. 2. Create config file The config file is the primary method to customize the agent's behavior. You can also use server-side configuration or environment variables. After you install the package, the newrelic-admin script will be in the same directory as the Python executable. To create the agent config file, run this command in the Python executable's directory and include your license key: newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini Copy The generate-config command creates the newrelic.ini config file. 3. Integrate the agent You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. If you use any of the following services, follow these guidelines before continuing to the admin script procedure. uWSGI The agent can be used with uWSGI version 1.2.6 or higher. The recommended integration method (using the admin script via the command line) can be used for uWSGI, but you will need to supply certain specific command line options to the uwsgi executable. These include: Option Purpose --enable-threads By default uWSGI does not enable threading support within the Python interpreter core, so you cannot create background threads from Python code. However, the Python agent relies on being able to create background threads, so this option is required. To automatically configure uWSGI for multiple threads, use the --threads option. --single-interpreter By default uWSGI will execute Python code within a sub-interpreter of the process rather than the main Python interpreter created when Python is first initialized. This allows multiple separate Python web applications to run within one process, but keep them separated so they do not interfere with each other. Older versions of uWSGI can fail when using sub-interpreters with threading enabled. Recommendation: Use the --single-interpreter option, and restrict it to a single web application per process. mod_wsgi If you use mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. If you use mod_wsgi-express, you can run the admin script via the command line. For more information, see the New Relic mod_wsgi documentation. Tornado 6 The agent currently provides support for Tornado 6 only. For more information, see the Tornado 6 web framework documentation. WebFaction Python web applications on WebFaction typically use Apache/mod_wsgi. With mod_wsgi, you cannot use the recommended integration method of running the admin script via the command line. Instead, you must manually integrate the Python agent in your app code. To run the newrelic-admin script via the command line, place the following in front of your standard app startup command: The path to the New Relic config file The newrelic-admin run-program script command For example, here are instructions for a Bourne-style shell. You may need to adjust these instructions for a different shell. If you use a Python gunicorn web server and your startup command is: gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy Then use this command: NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application Copy For more details about using the admin script, see Running the admin script from command line. If you cannot use the admin script method or don't want to, see the manual integration method. 4. Restart app and check for data When you finish the integration procedure: Restart your app server. Wait five minutes. View your app's data in APM's Summary page. If data does not appear after five minutes, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Additional steps Here are some suggested next steps after installing the Python agent for your app: Explore your data in New Relic One and get comfortable with the standard user interface features. Learn about APM's Summary page, the Transactions page, and other performance monitoring features. Change your application's name, and use other configuration options. Set up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Configure custom events and custom attributes to collect additional data from your app.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

For simpler install instructions that will work for the majority of Python frameworks (including Django), see the standard installation guide. Read this advanced guide if you cannot use the standard install, or if you want more detailed information about the installation steps. Requirements Before you install the Python agent: Read and understand the compatibility and requirements. Have your New Relic account's license key. (If you don't have one already, sign up for a New Relic account.) Summary of install process Here's a summary of how to install the Python agent: Download and install the Python agent package. Create config file. Integrate the agent with your app. Restart your app. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment or use other hosting services, such as Heroku. 1. Download and install Download and install the agent package using your preferred procedure. For example: pip install (RECOMMENDED) Install the newrelic package directly from PyPi by running: pip install newrelic Copy easy_install Run: easy_install newrelic Copy We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions.

      "body": "Syntax newrelic.agent.record_exception(exc=None, value=None, tb=None, params={}, ignore_errors=[], application=None) Copy This API has been deprecated. Please use notice_error(). Description Records details of a Python exception as an error. By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. Use record_exception to record any Python exception as an error, which can then be found in New Relic One. If no parameters are provided, the details of the exception currently being handled will be used. You can record up to five distinct exceptions per transaction, and up to 20 total exceptions across all transactions per harvest cycle. When record_exception() is called within the context of a monitored web request or background task, the details of the exception will be reported against the application that the request or task is being reported to. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. Parameters Tip In almost all cases, record_exception will require no parameters. Parameter Description exc class object Optional and rarely used. The exception type of the exception being handled (a class object). One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. value int, string, other Optional and rarely used. The exception parameter. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. tb object Optional and rarely used. A traceback object that encapsulates the call stack at the point where the exception originally occurred. One of three values (exc, value, and tb) returned from sys.exc_info(). If you want to pass any of these parameters, all three must be set and and cannot be set to None. If you only pass one of these values, the call will not work. params dict Optional. Custom attributes to add to the error event (in addition to any custom attributes already added to the transaction). If high security mode is enabled, this will not work. ignore_errors string Optional. Errors to ignore can be passed in the form module:class. Useful when certain types of exceptions should always be ignored and never recorded. application application object Optional. If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application object is provided. Return values None. Examples Simple example of reporting exceptions In large majority of cases, you won't need to pass any paramters. You would just call the following where you want to report an exception: newrelic.agent.record_exception() Copy Call with sys.exc_info() tuple and additional parameters An example of record_exception using sys.exc_info() data: def complex_ignore_errors(exc, val, tb): # do some logic here return False newrelic.agent.record_exception(params={'my_special_exception': True}, ignore_errors=complex_ignore_errors) Copy Example using callback If you need to filter exceptions dynamically based on the attributes of a specific exception type, you can supply a callback function: def _ignore_errors(exc, value, tb): if instance(value, HTTPError): if value.status == 404: return True newrelic.agent.record_exception(ignore_errors=_ignore_errors) Copy If the exception is to be ignored, set the return value for the callable to True. Return False if the exception should never be ignored regardless of any other checks, and None if subsequent checks and inbuilt rules should determine if the exception should be ignored. A callback would normally return either True or None.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The Python agent API allows you to customize and extend your monitoring. Use the Python agent API to: Manually instrument an unsupported framework or third-party system. Add instrumentation to supplement the agent's default monitoring. This document describes some of the available Python API calls. For a description of all our available APIs, see Introduction to APIs. Custom instrumentation or API If your goal is custom instrumentation, consider using the configuration file method, which allows you to add functions and class methods to the config file that will be auto-instrumented by the agent. The benefit of the config-file method is that it does not require you to change your application code. However, the Python agent API is much more powerful and is best for setting up more complex and tailored instrumentation. To ensure you have access to the full API functionality, update to the latest Python agent. Monitor transactions and segments The Python agent is compatible with most of the common WSGI web frameworks. If the agent supports your framework, web requests automatically will be captured as transactions and displayed in the New Relic One UI. A transaction can also have function-level segments that are captured as part of a transaction trace. Use these methods to monitor web transactions, non-web transactions, and transaction segments: If you want to... Do this... Monitor WSGI web transactions The Python agent automatically captures web transactions for supported frameworks. If you do not have a supported framework, you can use the wsgi_application function to monitor your WSGI entry point. Monitor non-web transactions The Python agent classifies non-web transactions as background tasks. To capture non-web transactions, use background_task. Capture more details about a transaction If your transaction traces do not have the level of detail you want: Use function_trace to capture more function-level detail in transactions. Use datastore_trace to capture more detail about datastore calls. Ignore a transaction Use any of these options: To ignore a transaction altogether, use ignore_transaction. To prevent a transaction from producing a transaction trace, use suppress_transaction_trace. To end a transaction before the agent would end it automatically, use end_of_transaction. Add and edit transaction metadata Sometimes the code you target is visible in our UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them when querying. Use these calls when you want to change the metadata of an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Get reference to current transaction To return an object representing the current transaction, use current_transaction. This is required by some other Python agent API calls. Change the name of a transaction Use set_transaction_name. Add metadata (such as a customer's subscription level) to transactions Add custom attributes to your transactions using add_custom_parameter, or use other API calls to report custom data. Mark a transaction as a background job To convert a web transaction into a background task so that it appears as a non-web transaction in the UI, use set_background_task. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score Use suppress_apdex_metric. Report custom events and custom metric data The agent reports data in two primary forms: Metric data measures numeric, time-based values; for example, connections per minute. Event data captures discrete event information. Events have key-value attributes attached to them. You can analyze and query event data. Use these methods to create new event data and new metric data: If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event for use when querying your data. Use record_custom_event. Report time-based metrics on application performance To report a single metric, use record_custom_metric. To report a set of metrics, use record_custom_metrics. Report an exception as an error By default, the Python agent only reports unhandled exceptions. To report a Python exception as an error, use notice_error. Report query string parameters For security reasons, query string parameters associated with web transactions are disabled by default. Use capture_request_params to enable them. Tag events with metadata To add attributes to events for more detailed analysis in Insights or error analytics, use add_custom_parameter. Generate metrics from data sources and data factories To generate metrics with a pull-style API rather than the push-style API implemented by record_custom_metric(), use these API calls: register_data_source data_source_generator data_source_factory Message-related calls These API calls allow you to collect performance data on your message-passing architecture or service; for example, RabbitMQ. To use these calls, make sure you have Python agent version 2.88.0.72 or higher. If you want to... Do this... Report messages as a transaction Use message_transaction. Report message details as transaction trace segments Use message_trace. Implement distributed tracing These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Services and applications monitored by our agents will automatically pass distributed tracing context to each other when using a supported framework. When not using a supported framework, you will need to use the distributed tracing APIs to manually accept this context. Supported web frameworks (for example, Flask, Django, Tornado) will automatically call accept_distributed_trace_payload when creating a transaction. Supported external web services libraries will automatically call create_distributed_trace_payload before making an external HTTP call. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Create a payload to be sent to a called service. Use create_distributed_trace_payload. Accept a payload sent from the first service; this will link these services together in a trace Use accept_distributed_trace_payload. Agent configuration, initialization, shutdown These calls help you manage Python agent behavior, such as initializing and integrating the agent, and referencing or changing configuration settings: If you want to... Do this... Initialize the agent To initialize the Python agent with a specific configuration file as part of advanced integration process, use initialize. Get a reference to the application object The application object represents an agent-monitored application and is used by some Python agent API calls. Get a reference to configuration settings To control the Python agent's behavior, you can use configuration settings. To get a reference to config file and environment variable settings and make changes to them, use global_settings. To get a reference to all settings, including server-side configuration from our UI, use application_settings. Shut down the agent To forcibly shut down the agent instead of allowing it to make the standard final attempt to upload data, use shutdown_agent. Control the Browser monitoring agent You can install the browser monitoring agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting the browser agent JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser agent and the Python agent. If you want to... Do this... Monitor specific page views To inject the browser agent header and footer JavaScript snippets into views you want to monitor, use both get_browser_timing_header and get_browser_timing_footer. Disable monitoring of specific page views To disable browser monitoring for specific page views, use disable_browser_autorum.",

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true). Troubleshooting Follow the troubleshooting procedures if you are unable to view any browser timing data.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation.

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "With the release of Python Agent version v7.0.0.166, upon agent upgrade, customers will now have Distributed Tracing on by default. This update eliminates the need to configure the agent in order to have access to distributed traces. Distributed Tracing gives software teams working in modern environments an easy way to capture, visualize, and analyze traces through complex architectures, including architectures that use both monoliths and microservices. What’s the impact? With this change, customers will see distributed traces immediately upon upgrading to Python version v7.0.0.166. Distributed Tracing on by default provides more data and better visibility for cross-application requests. If you do not need this feature, it can be turned off in the Python agent configuration file by setting distributed_tracing.enabled=false OR by setting the environment variable NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=false. If you need more traces and are experiencing dropped spans, the agent reservoir can be expanded to accommodate more spans. To do so, set environment variable or config item called span_events.max_samples_stored to a value greater than 2,000 up to a maximum value of 10,000. Note that increasing this value may impact memory usage. With Distributed Tracing on by default, Cross Application Tracing (CAT) will now be deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the agent. Customers on CAT will now see distributed traces instead. Customers who would like to revert back to CAT can do so in the configuration file by setting cross_application_tracer.enabled = true. It is however recommended to stay using distributed tracing, given that CAT will be removed in the future.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data. If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. For more help",

Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "With the Python agent, you can add browser monitoring to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent. To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Support for automatic instrumentation The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator. Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server. WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported. Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported. The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the write() callback returned from the WSGI start_response() function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python. Use automatic instrumentation The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid. Disable instrumentation for specific pages If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this Python agent API call into the code for that request handler: newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum() Copy If you are using a WSGI server that allows per-request configuration, such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the newrelic.disable_browser_autorum key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application. For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL: <Location /login> SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true </Location> Copy Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, or if you want to collect browser agent data for only some pages. The calls in this procedure must be placed on every request you want to monitor. You cannot call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the newrelic.ini file, set browser_monitoring.auto_instrument to false. Restart your application. Place these calls into the request handler of every page you want to monitor: import newrelic.agent header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header() footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer() Copy Pass the header and footer variables to the HTML response. On the corresponding page, insert the header variable in the <head> element. Place the header variable after any charset properties or any meta tags for http-equiv with a value of X-UA-Compatible. Insert the footer variable before the end of the <body> element. Wait a few minutes, then check your browser monitoring data.

This includes metrics related to CPU usage, memory usage, and garbage collection. CPU Usage With CPU runtime metrics, you can monitor CPU usage by examining user and system CPU utilization, and also see time spent in different components of the CPU. The following CPU usage metrics are available: CPU Time: Track the amount of time being spent in different states of the CPU. This includes user (time running application code) and system (time spent in the operating system). This metric is represented as total elapsed time in seconds. CPU Utilization: Analyze the amount of processing resources being utilized over time by different components of the CPU. This includes the user component (for running application code) and system component (for running kernel code). This metric is reported as a percentage representing the time spent in the specified CPU component divided by total elapsed CPU time. Memory Usage You can monitor your system’s overall memory consumption and utilization by process and host. The following memory usage metrics are available: Total Physical Memory: Monitor the amount of total physical memory in megabytes being used by your system over time. This metric is also available for individual process IDs. Memory Utilization: Track memory utilization over time for your system and for individual processes. This metric is represented by the value of the total physical memory being used by your system (or a specific process) divided by the total amount of memory available. Garbage Collection Important Garbage collection profiling is available in Python agent version 6.2.0.156 and higher and is disabled by default in the agent. To enable it, check out our documentation here. The garbage collector finds unused data objects and reclaims that memory space so it can be used by another process. The Python agent provides the following garbage collection metrics: Object Count by Type: Gain insight into the most common object types being collected by the garbage collector by viewing their associated collection counts. You can customize the maximum number of object types you would like to see reported by this metric type by configuring the top_object_count_limit setting. Object Count by Generation: As collection occurs in each generation of the garbage collector, objects that survive are promoted into higher generations. This metric allows you to view the number of objects being stored in each of the garbage collector’s generations over time. Total Time by Generation: Analyze the amount of time the garbage collector is spending in each generation of collection. Garbage Collector Collections: The number of collections is influenced by the object threshold set for each generation. When the threshold is reached, a collection process will be triggered. Collections can also be manually triggered within application code with calls to gc.collect(). This metric reports the number of garbage collector sweeps that have happened in each generation over time. Garbage Collector Uncollectable: In some instances, the garbage collector may not be able to reach and free a certain object, deeming it uncollectable. This metric allows you to view the number of objects that were uncollectable by the garbage collector in each generation. Garbage Collector Collected: This metric reports the total number of objects that were collected by the garbage collector in each generation.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6.

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask GraphQL gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.10 October 04, 2021 October 12, 2021 3.11 October 03, 2022 November 2022 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.6 December 2021 Python agent versions released after March 2022 will not support Python 3.6. For more information, see our Python agent release notes. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent.

By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds.

      "body": "New Relic for Ruby allows you to selectively disable instrumentation for particular requests within your Rails or Sinatra application. Blocking all instrumentation Call newrelic_ignore with no arguments from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application to prevent instrumentation of all requests serviced by that controller or application: newrelic_ignore Copy Using newrelic_ignore prevents the agent from recording any performance data (metrics, transaction traces, events, traced errors, and so on) for the targeted transactions, and will also prevent the transactions from contributing to your overall Apdex score. Ignoring specific actions with Rails If you want to ignore only specific actions with a Rails controller, you can use the :only or :except options with newrelic_ignore. For example, to ignore only the index and show actions on the controller, use: newrelic_ignore :only => [:index, :show] Copy To ignore all actions on the controller except index: newrelic_ignore :except => [:index] Copy Ignoring specific routes with Sinatra If you want to ignore only specific routes within your Sinatra application, you can pass a Sinatra-style route definition to newrelic_ignore from within your Sinatra application. For more information, see Sinatra: Ignoring routes. Ignoring Apdex contributions If you want to prevent all actions in a controller from contributing to your Apdex score, but still want other performance data, use newrelic_ignore_apdex: newrelic_ignore_apdex Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_apdex supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Blocking browser instrumentation Using newrelic_ignore_enduser prevents the agent from automatically inserting the JavaScript used to capture browser monitoring data. Server-side instrumentation will be unaffected. To prevent browser agent injection for all actions in a controller, add a call like this to the controller class: newrelic_ignore_enduser Copy In a Rails application, newrelic_ignore_enduser supports the same :only and :except options as newrelic_ignore. In a Sinatra application, it will accept the same Sinatra-style route for targeting specific transactions. Ignoring transactions dynamically In some cases, you may want to base the decision to ignore a specific transaction on criteria only known at runtime, during the request. For scenarios like this, the declarative mechanisms explained above aren't a good fit. Starting in Ruby agent version 3.9.2, you can instead use the following family of API calls from any point within your transaction: NewRelic::Agent.ignore_transaction NewRelic::Agent.ignore_apdex NewRelic::Agent.ignore_enduser Copy These methods will have a similar results to the newrelic_ignore, newrelic_ignore_apdex, and newrelic_ignore_enduser calls, but can be called during a request instead of during the class definition. Ignoring transactions by URL with configuration You can ignore transactions by URL using the rules.ignore_url_regexes configuration setting: rules: ignore_url_regexes: [\"secret\", \"^/admin\"] Copy This configuration will only prevent Transaction events that match the set pattern from reporting. Use any of the newrelic_ignore* family of methods if you would like to prevent all data, such as trace data, from reporting from a transaction. Note that regexes do not include any type of anchoring by default. The /secret/ regex will match 'newrelic.com/secret/login' and it will also match 'newrelic.com/users/secretpanda'. The anchored admin regex will match 'newrelic.com/admin/praetorians' but it will not match 'newrelic.com/users/totally-real-admin'. If necessary you may also provide a list of regexes in a comma-separated string, allowing you to set ignore regexes with an environment variable: NEW_RELIC_RULES_IGNORE_URL_REGEXES=\"secret,^/admin\" Copy As always configuration from environment variables will override configuration in newrelic.yml. Troubleshooting The newrelic_ignore* family of methods will only work from within Rails controller classes, or Sinatra applications (subclasses of Sinatra::Base). Other applications should use the NewRelic::Agent.ignore_* family of calls from within each request that you would like to ignore, which will work in any context. If you get a NoMethodError when trying to use newrelic_ignore from within a Rails controller or Sinatra application, make sure that newrelic_rpm has been required before you try to call newrelic_ignore inside of your class definition.

The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "You can configure the New Relic Ruby agent with settings in a configuration file, environment variables, or programmatically with server-side configuration. This document summarizes the configuration options available for the Ruby agent. If the default value for a configuration option is (Dynamic), this means the Ruby agent calculates the default at runtime. The value for the config setting defaults to the value of another setting as appropriate. Configuration methods and precedence The primary (default) method to configure the Ruby agent is via the configuration file (newrelic.yml) in the config subdirectory. To set configuration values using environment variables: Add the prefix NEW_RELIC_ to the setting's name. Replace any periods . with underscores _. You can also configure a few values in the UI via server-side configuration. The Ruby agent follows this order of precedence for configuration: Environment variables Server-side configuration Configuration file (newrelic.yml) Default configuration settings In other words, environment variables override all other configuration settings and info, server-side configuration overrides the configuration file and default config settings, and so on. View and edit config file options The Ruby agent's newrelic.yml is a standard YAML configuration file. It typically includes a Defaults section at the top, plus sections below for each application environment; for example, Development, Testing, and Production. The Ruby agent determines which section of the newrelic.yml config file to read from by looking at certain environment variables to derive the application's environment. This can be useful, for example, when you want to use info for the log_level config setting in your production environment, and you want more verbose log_level config settings (such as debug in your development environment. Here is an example newrelic.yml config file: common: &default_settings license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' app_name: 'My Application Name' production: <<: *default_settings log_level: info development: <<: *default_settings log_level: debug Copy For non-Rails apps, the Ruby agent looks for the following environment variables, in this order, to determine the application environment: NEW_RELIC_ENV RUBY_ENV RAILS_ENV APP_ENV RACK_ENV If the Ruby agent does not detect values for any of those environment variables, it will default the application environment to development and read from the development section of the newrelic.yml config file. When running the Ruby agent in a Rails app, the agent first looks for the NEW_RELIC_ENV environment variable to determine the application environment and which section of the newrelic.yml to use. If NEW_RELIC_ENV is not present, the agent uses the Rails environment (RAILS_ENV or RAILS.env, depending on the version of Rails) . When you edit the config file, be sure to: Indent only with two spaces. Indent only where relevant, in stanzas such as error_collector. If you do not indent correctly, the agent may throw an Unable to parse configuration file error on startup. To view the most current list of available Ruby agent configuration options, use the rake newrelic:config:docs command. This document describes the most common options. Update the config file This documentation applies to the Ruby agent's latest release. For details on earlier versions, refer to the comments in newrelic.yml itself. To update newrelic.yml file after a new release, use the template in the base directory of the agent gem. When you update to new gem versions, examine or diff config/newrelic.yml and newrelic.yml in the installation directory to take advantage of new configuration options. Important Updating the gem does not automatically update config/newrelic.yml. General These settings are available for agent configuration. Some settings depend on your New Relic subscription level. license_key Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY Your New Relic license key. agent_enabled Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED If true, allows the Ruby agent to run. app_name Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Specify the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated by a semicolon ;. For example, MyApp or MyStagingApp;Instance1. monitor_mode Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MONITOR_MODE When true, the agent transmits data about your app to the New Relic collector. log_level Type String Default \"info\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Sets the level of detail of log messages. Possible log levels, in increasing verbosity, are: error, warn, info or debug. high_security Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_HIGH_SECURITY If true, enables high security mode. Ensure you understand the implications of high security mode before enabling this setting. security_policies_token Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN Applies Language Agent Security Policy settings. proxy_host Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_HOST Defines a host for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_port Type Integer Default 8080 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PORT Defines a port for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_user Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_USER Defines a user for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. proxy_pass Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PROXY_PASS Defines a password for communicating with the New Relic collector via a proxy server. capture_params Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_PARAMS When true, the agent captures HTTP request parameters and attaches them to transaction traces, traced errors, and TransactionError events. Caution When using the capture_params setting, the Ruby agent will not attempt to filter secret information. Recommendation: To filter secret information from request parameters, use the attributes.include setting instead. For more information, see the Ruby attribute examples. config_path Type String Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_PATH Path to newrelic.yml. If undefined, the agent checks the following directories (in order): config/newrelic.yml, newrelic.yml, $HOME/.newrelic/newrelic.yml and $HOME/newrelic.yml. apdex_t Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_APDEX_T DEPRECATED For agent versions 3.5.0 or higher, set your Apdex T via the New Relic UI. sync_startup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SYNC_STARTUP When set to true, forces a synchronous connection to the New Relic collector during application startup. For very short-lived processes, this helps ensure the New Relic agent has time to report. send_data_on_exit Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_SEND_DATA_ON_EXIT If true, enables the exit handler that sends data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout Type Integer Default 120 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TIMEOUT Defines the maximum number of seconds the agent should spend attempting to connect to the collector. force_install_exit_handler Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_FORCE_INSTALL_EXIT_HANDLER Forces the exit handler that sends all cached data to collector before shutting down to be installed regardless of detecting scenarios where it generally should not be. Known use-case for this option is where Sinatra is running as an embedded service within another framework and the agent is detecting the Sinatra app and skipping the at_exit handler as a result. Sinatra classically runs the entire application in an at_exit block and would otherwise misbehave if the Agent's at_exit handler was also installed in those circumstances. Note: send_data_on_exit should also be set to true in tandem with this setting. log_file_name Type String Default \"newrelic_agent.log\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_NAME Defines a name for the log file. log_file_path Type String Default \"log/\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LOG_FILE_PATH Defines a path to the agent log file, excluding the filename. prepend_active_record_instrumentation Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_PREPEND_ACTIVE_RECORD_INSTRUMENTATION If true, uses Module#prepend rather than alias_method for ActiveRecord instrumentation. capture_memcache_keys Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CAPTURE_MEMCACHE_KEYS Enable or disable the capture of memcache keys from transaction traces. message_tracer.segment_parameters.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MESSAGE_TRACER_SEGMENT_PARAMETERS_ENABLED If true, the agent will collect metadata about messages and attach them as segment parameters. marshaller Type String Default \"json\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_MARSHALLER Specifies a marshaller for transmitting data to the New Relic collector. Currently json is the only valid value for this setting. backport_fast_active_record_connection_lookup Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BACKPORT_FAST_ACTIVE_RECORD_CONNECTION_LOOKUP Backports the faster ActiveRecord connection lookup introduced in Rails 6, which improves agent performance when instrumenting ActiveRecord. Note that this setting may not be compatible with other gems that patch ActiveRecord. labels Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_LABELS A dictionary of label names and values that will be applied to the data sent from this agent. May also be expressed as a semicolon-delimited ; string of colon-separated : pairs. For example, <var>Server</var>:<var>One</var>;<var>Data Center</var>:<var>Primary</var>. ca_bundle_path Type String Default nil Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CA_BUNDLE_PATH Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by New Relic's data collection service. datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_INSTANCE_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow SQL traces. datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_DATASTORE_TRACER_DATABASE_NAME_REPORTING_ENABLED If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. clear_transaction_state_after_fork Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_CLEAR_TRANSACTION_STATE_AFTER_FORK If true, the agent will clear Tracer::State in Agent.drop_buffered_data. exclude_newrelic_header Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_EXCLUDE_NEWRELIC_HEADER Allows newrelic distributed tracing headers to be suppressed on outbound requests. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST Configures the hostname for the Trace Observer Host. When configured, enables tail-based sampling by sending all recorded spans to a Trace Observer for further sampling decisions, irrespective of any usual agent sampling decision. infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Type Integer Default 443 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_PORT Configures the TCP/IP port for the Trace Observer Host Transaction Tracer The transaction traces feature collects detailed information from a selection of transactions, including a summary of the calling sequence, a breakdown of time spent, and a list of SQL queries and their query plans (on mysql and postgresql). Available features depend on your New Relic subscription level. transaction_tracer.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_ENABLED If true, enables collection of transaction traces. transaction_tracer.transaction_threshold Type Float Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. Transactions with a duration longer than this threshold are eligible for transaction traces. Specify a float value or the string apdex_f. transaction_tracer.record_sql Type String Default \"obfuscated\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_SQL Obfuscation level for SQL queries reported in transaction trace nodes. By default, this is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to none. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. transaction_tracer.record_redis_arguments Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_RECORD_REDIS_ARGUMENTS If true, the agent records Redis command arguments in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled instead. transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_THRESHOLD Threshold (in seconds) above which the agent will collect explain plans. Relevant only when explain_enabled is true. transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_EXPLAIN_ENABLED If true, enables the collection of explain plans in transaction traces. This setting will also apply to explain plans in slow SQL traces if slow_sql.explain_enabled is not set separately. transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Type Float Default 0.5 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_STACK_TRACE_THRESHOLD Specify a threshold in seconds. The agent includes stack traces in transaction trace nodes when the stack trace duration exceeds this threshold. transaction_tracer.limit_segments Type Integer Default 4000 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_TRANSACTION_TRACER_LIMIT_SEGMENTS Maximum number of transaction trace nodes to record in a single transaction trace. Error Collector The agent collects and reports all uncaught exceptions by default. These configuration options allow you to customize the error collection. For information on ignored and expected errors, see this page on Error Analytics in APM. To set expected errors via the NewRelic::Agent.notice_error Ruby method, consult the Ruby Agent API. error_collector.enabled Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_ENABLED If true, the agent captures traced errors and error count metrics. error_collector.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default true Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use error_collector.attributes.enabled instead. error_collector.ignore_errors Type String Default \"ActionController::RoutingError,Sinatra::NotFound\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_ERRORS DEPRECATED Use error_collector.ignore_classes instead. Specify a comma-delimited list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution Server side configuration takes precedence for this setting over all environment configurations. This differs from all other configuration settings where environment variable take precedence over server side configuration. error_collector.ignore_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should ignore. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be ignored. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.ignore_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_IGNORE_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be ignored. error_collector.expected_classes Type Array Default [] Environ variable None A list of error classes that the agent should treat as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_messages Type Hash Default {} Environ variable None A map of error classes to a list of messages. When an error of one of the classes specified here occurs, if its error message contains one of the strings corresponding to it here, that error will be treated as expected. Caution This option can't be set via environment variable. error_collector.expected_status_codes Type String Default \"\" Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_EXPECTED_STATUS_CODES A comma separated list of status codes, possibly including ranges. Errors associated with these status codes, where applicable, will be treated as expected. error_collector.max_backtrace_frames Type Integer Default 50 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_BACKTRACE_FRAMES Defines the maximum number of frames in an error backtrace. Backtraces over this amount are truncated at the beginning and end. error_collector.capture_events Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_CAPTURE_EVENTS If true, the agent collects TransactionError events. error_collector.max_event_samples_stored Type Integer Default 100 Environ variable NEW_RELIC_ERROR_COLLECTOR_MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED Defines the maximum number of TransactionError events sent to Insights per harvest cycle. Browser Monitoring The browser monitoring page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM) gives you insight into the performance real users are experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Type Boolean Default (Dynamic) Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_AUTO_INSTRUMENT If true, enables auto-injection of the JavaScript header for page load timing (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). browser_monitoring.capture_attributes Type Boolean Default false Environ variable NEW_RELIC_BROWSER_MONITORING_CAPTURE_ATTRIBUTES DEPRECATED Use browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",
