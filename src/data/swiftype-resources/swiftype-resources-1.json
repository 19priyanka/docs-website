      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number. To edit billing settings, use the Billing UI. Adjustments to billing settings will take effect for the next billing period. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the New Relic APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription, go to the billing UI. View or change current subscription To adjust your subscription settings, use the Billing UI. If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your usage, use the usage UI. View or update billing information To view or update your New Relic account's billing information, see the billing UI.",

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention.

Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you can use one of two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the OneLogin app to send user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic.

To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you can use one of two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the Azure app to send user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users.

      "body": "If you want to implement New Relic's automated user management (AUM) and import your users from an identity provider, first read Introduction to AUM to learn about supported identity providers and when you'd want to use our SCIM API, documented below. Requirements If you have an identity provider that has a New Relic app (Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin), see the guides for those. The SCIM API is meant for organizations that either aren't using those identity providers, or that want to use the SCIM API for additional configuration not available with the apps (for example, managing user type). Before using our SCIM API, you must first enable SCIM for an authentication domain. Note that after you set up an integration with the SCIM API, there are next steps to do, including downgrading some users to basic users, and granting user groups access to New Relic accounts. Tutorial See the SCIM API tutorial for more specific instructions on using this API. SCIM service provider New Relic’s SCIM service provider follows the SCIM 2.0 API as described in RFCs 7643 and 7644. You do not need to implement all aspects of the SCIM 2.0 specification to integrate your user information with New Relic. In fact, the New Relic service provider itself does not implement all aspects of the specification. This document describes the features from the specification available for an integration with New Relic. Authentication Authentication requires a bearer token. This bearer token is specific to your New Relic authentication domain and is displayed when first enabling SCIM for an authentication domain. Supported resources The New Relic service provider supports the following SCIM resources: Group , User , Service provider config , Resource type and Schema. Bulk and Search are not supported. For more information on how the RFC describes the resource endpoints, see RFC 7644 SCIM Protocol Specification. Schemas New Relic uses a subset of the available fields in the SCIM core schema. Other SCIM fields are ignored if they are included in incoming requests. The fields used by New Relic are: Group: SCIM field name Description displayName Required. Name of the group. members List of users in the group. User: SCIM Field Name Description externalId Unique identifier for the user used by your system. userName Required. Unique identifier for the user within New Relic’s system. Use the user’s email address. name.familyName Last name of the user. name.givenName First name of the user. emails or emails.value Required. Email address of the user. timezone Time zone of the user in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). active Required. Boolean indicating whether or not the user should be active or inactive within New Relic. groups List of groups to which the user belongs. New Relic user type (basic vs full) schema This is an optional schema extension for New Relic-specific user attributes. Currently this provides control only over a user's user type (basic user versus full user). For a tutorial showing how to use this, see the SCIM API tutorial. urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User: SCIM field name Description nrUserType The user's type: 'full user' or 'basic user'. Supported actions SCIM provides several options for manipulating groups and users. The New Relic service provider supports the following options. When configuring, be aware that: Only simple filtering is supported. The eq operator may be used with a basic filter expression. For example, “displayName eq \"Example Group 1”. Other operators are not supported. PUT updates do not require that all fields be included. Fields that are not included will not be changed. When doing a PUT, if a required field already has the appropriate value, it is not necessary to include the field. Supported actions are: Create group Example request: POST /Groups { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"members\": [] } Copy Example response: 201 Created { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] } Copy Get group Example request: GET /Groups/YOUR_GROUP_ID Copy Example response: 200 OK { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] } Copy Get group by query Example request: GET /Groups?filter=displayName eq \"Example Group 1\" Copy Example response: 200 OK { \"totalResults\": 1, \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse\" ], \"Resources\": [{ \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] }] } Copy Update group with PUT In the request, include the fields that you want to change.

Section numbers refer to RFC section numbers. Items in this section could change as we work to bring our service provider into full compliance with the RFC. RFC section name RFC section number Deviation description Creating Resources 3.3. The meta.location field is not set. Filtering 3.4.2.2. The only currently supported operator is eq. Field names are case sensitive. String attributes are compared in a case sensitive manner. Prefixing the field name with the schema is not supported. For example, filter=urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:userName eq \"johnsmith\" will not work. /Me Authenticated Subject Alias 3.11. GET with the /Me resource returns a 404 Not Found. Service Provider Configuration Endpoints 4. The service provider feature discovery endpoints do not support filtering. Bearer Token and Cookie Considerations 7.4. Bearer tokens do not have a set expiration date. Next steps when you're done Downgrade users When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you can see them in the User management UI. By default, users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you have two options: Use the User management UI. Use the SCIM API to manage user type. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you can use one of two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the OneLogin app to send user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users.

      "body": "If you want to implement New Relic's automated user management (AUM) and import your users from an identity provider, first read Introduction to AUM to learn about supported identity providers and when you'd want to use our SCIM API, documented below. Requirements If you have an identity provider that has a New Relic app (Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin), see the guides for those. The SCIM API is meant for organizations that either aren't using those identity providers, or that want to use the SCIM API for additional configuration not available with the apps (for example, managing user type). Before using our SCIM API, you must first enable SCIM for an authentication domain. Note that after you set up an integration with the SCIM API, there are next steps to do, including downgrading some users to basic users, and granting user groups access to New Relic accounts. Tutorial See the SCIM API tutorial for more specific instructions on using this API. SCIM service provider New Relic’s SCIM service provider follows the SCIM 2.0 API as described in RFCs 7643 and 7644. You do not need to implement all aspects of the SCIM 2.0 specification to integrate your user information with New Relic. In fact, the New Relic service provider itself does not implement all aspects of the specification. This document describes the features from the specification available for an integration with New Relic. Authentication Authentication requires a bearer token. This bearer token is specific to your New Relic authentication domain and is displayed when first enabling SCIM for an authentication domain. Supported resources The New Relic service provider supports the following SCIM resources: Group , User , Service provider config , Resource type and Schema. Bulk and Search are not supported. For more information on how the RFC describes the resource endpoints, see RFC 7644 SCIM Protocol Specification. Schemas New Relic uses a subset of the available fields in the SCIM core schema. Other SCIM fields are ignored if they are included in incoming requests. The fields used by New Relic are: Group: SCIM field name Description displayName Required. Name of the group. members List of users in the group. User: SCIM Field Name Description externalId Unique identifier for the user used by your system. userName Required. Unique identifier for the user within New Relic’s system. Use the user’s email address. name.familyName Last name of the user. name.givenName First name of the user. emails or emails.value Required. Email address of the user. timezone Time zone of the user in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). active Required. Boolean indicating whether or not the user should be active or inactive within New Relic. groups List of groups to which the user belongs. New Relic user type (basic vs full) schema This is an optional schema extension for New Relic-specific user attributes. Currently this provides control only over a user's user type (basic user versus full user). For a tutorial showing how to use this, see the SCIM API tutorial. urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User: SCIM field name Description nrUserType The user's type: 'full user' or 'basic user'. Supported actions SCIM provides several options for manipulating groups and users. The New Relic service provider supports the following options. When configuring, be aware that: Only simple filtering is supported. The eq operator may be used with a basic filter expression. For example, “displayName eq \"Example Group 1”. Other operators are not supported. PUT updates do not require that all fields be included. Fields that are not included will not be changed. When doing a PUT, if a required field already has the appropriate value, it is not necessary to include the field. Supported actions are: Create group Example request: POST /Groups { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"members\": [] } Copy Example response: 201 Created { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] } Copy Get group Example request: GET /Groups/YOUR_GROUP_ID Copy Example response: 200 OK { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] } Copy Get group by query Example request: GET /Groups?filter=displayName eq \"Example Group 1\" Copy Example response: 200 OK { \"totalResults\": 1, \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse\" ], \"Resources\": [{ \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] }] } Copy Update group with PUT In the request, include the fields that you want to change.

Section numbers refer to RFC section numbers. Items in this section could change as we work to bring our service provider into full compliance with the RFC. RFC section name RFC section number Deviation description Creating Resources 3.3. The meta.location field is not set. Filtering 3.4.2.2. The only currently supported operator is eq. Field names are case sensitive. String attributes are compared in a case sensitive manner. Prefixing the field name with the schema is not supported. For example, filter=urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:userName eq \"johnsmith\" will not work. /Me Authenticated Subject Alias 3.11. GET with the /Me resource returns a 404 Not Found. Service Provider Configuration Endpoints 4. The service provider feature discovery endpoints do not support filtering. Bearer Token and Cookie Considerations 7.4. Bearer tokens do not have a set expiration date. Next steps when you're done Downgrade users When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you can see them in the User management UI. By default, users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you have two options: Use the User management UI. Use the SCIM API to manage user type. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you can use one of two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the Azure app to send user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "If you want to implement New Relic's automated user management (AUM) and import your users from an identity provider, first read Introduction to AUM to learn about supported identity providers and when you'd want to use our SCIM API, documented below. Requirements If you have an identity provider that has a New Relic app (Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin), see the guides for those. The SCIM API is meant for organizations that either aren't using those identity providers, or that want to use the SCIM API for additional configuration not available with the apps (for example, managing user type). Before using our SCIM API, you must first enable SCIM for an authentication domain. Note that after you set up an integration with the SCIM API, there are next steps to do, including downgrading some users to basic users, and granting user groups access to New Relic accounts. Tutorial See the SCIM API tutorial for more specific instructions on using this API. SCIM service provider New Relic’s SCIM service provider follows the SCIM 2.0 API as described in RFCs 7643 and 7644. You do not need to implement all aspects of the SCIM 2.0 specification to integrate your user information with New Relic. In fact, the New Relic service provider itself does not implement all aspects of the specification. This document describes the features from the specification available for an integration with New Relic. Authentication Authentication requires a bearer token. This bearer token is specific to your New Relic authentication domain and is displayed when first enabling SCIM for an authentication domain. Supported resources The New Relic service provider supports the following SCIM resources: Group , User , Service provider config , Resource type and Schema. Bulk and Search are not supported. For more information on how the RFC describes the resource endpoints, see RFC 7644 SCIM Protocol Specification. Schemas New Relic uses a subset of the available fields in the SCIM core schema. Other SCIM fields are ignored if they are included in incoming requests. The fields used by New Relic are: Group: SCIM field name Description displayName Required. Name of the group. members List of users in the group. User: SCIM Field Name Description externalId Unique identifier for the user used by your system. userName Required. Unique identifier for the user within New Relic’s system. Use the user’s email address. name.familyName Last name of the user. name.givenName First name of the user. emails or emails.value Required. Email address of the user. timezone Time zone of the user in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). active Required. Boolean indicating whether or not the user should be active or inactive within New Relic. groups List of groups to which the user belongs. New Relic user type (basic vs full) schema This is an optional schema extension for New Relic-specific user attributes. Currently this provides control only over a user's user type (basic user versus full user). For a tutorial showing how to use this, see the SCIM API tutorial. urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User: SCIM field name Description nrUserType The user's type: 'full user' or 'basic user'. Supported actions SCIM provides several options for manipulating groups and users. The New Relic service provider supports the following options. When configuring, be aware that: Only simple filtering is supported. The eq operator may be used with a basic filter expression. For example, “displayName eq \"Example Group 1”. Other operators are not supported. PUT updates do not require that all fields be included. Fields that are not included will not be changed. When doing a PUT, if a required field already has the appropriate value, it is not necessary to include the field. Supported actions are: Create group Example request: POST /Groups { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"members\": [] } Copy Example response: 201 Created { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] } Copy Get group Example request: GET /Groups/YOUR_GROUP_ID Copy Example response: 200 OK { \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] } Copy Get group by query Example request: GET /Groups?filter=displayName eq \"Example Group 1\" Copy Example response: 200 OK { \"totalResults\": 1, \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse\" ], \"Resources\": [{ \"schemas\": [ \"urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group\" ], \"id\": \"d0652232-b14f-434d-9c6f-36de7e1ab010\", \"displayName\": \"Example Group 1\", \"meta\": { \"resourceType\": \"Group\", \"created\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\", \"lastModified\": \"2019-11-08T21:33:13.055Z\" }, \"members\": [] }] } Copy Update group with PUT In the request, include the fields that you want to change.

Section numbers refer to RFC section numbers. Items in this section could change as we work to bring our service provider into full compliance with the RFC. RFC section name RFC section number Deviation description Creating Resources 3.3. The meta.location field is not set. Filtering 3.4.2.2. The only currently supported operator is eq. Field names are case sensitive. String attributes are compared in a case sensitive manner. Prefixing the field name with the schema is not supported. For example, filter=urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User:userName eq \"johnsmith\" will not work. /Me Authenticated Subject Alias 3.11. GET with the /Me resource returns a 404 Not Found. Service Provider Configuration Endpoints 4. The service provider feature discovery endpoints do not support filtering. Bearer Token and Cookie Considerations 7.4. Bearer tokens do not have a set expiration date. Next steps when you're done Downgrade users When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you can see them in the User management UI. By default, users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you have two options: Use the User management UI. Use the SCIM API to manage user type. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you can use one of two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the OneLogin app to send user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users.

This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, you can use one of two options: Use the User management UI to set users to basic. Configure the OneLogin app to send user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users.

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing plan, not our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation. For more help For details about the data retention of other products or integrations, see that specific documentation.",

For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number. To edit billing settings, use the Billing UI. Adjustments to billing settings will take effect for the next billing period. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the New Relic APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription, go to the billing UI. View or change current subscription To adjust your subscription settings, use the Billing UI. If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your usage, use the usage UI. View or update billing information To view or update your New Relic account's billing information, see the billing UI.",

After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration for users on our original user model: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users on our original user model that are authenticating via SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration for users on our original user model: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users on our original user model that are authenticating via SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization.

After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration for users on our original user model: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our original user model. Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a SAML certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used. Requirements Requirements include: These docs apply for managing users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. Access to this feature requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Owner role required SSO settings UI page To find the New Relic SSO settings page: from the account dropdown, click Account settings, then click Security and authentication, then click Single sign on. If you don't see this UI, review the requirements. Providers supported by New Relic For a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic title bar, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. Providers include: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 SAML information in New Relic account To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic SSO settings UI page: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users on our original user model that are authenticating via SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

      "body": "Pinpoint and solve issues down to the line of code with Node.js monitoring from New Relic. With features like service maps and error analytics, our Node.js agent helps you get the full picture of your app environment. Why it matters Many Node application requests are based on raw URLs. Our solution is different. New Relic for Node.js assumes it can group requests to your application into transactions instead of HTTP requests. Transactions are defined by giving one or more request paths a name. These names are used to: Visualize where your app is spending its time (in transaction breakdowns). Identify slow requests. Group metrics. Show you which portions of your application are suffering from slow database performance. Installation To install our agent, you need to sign up for New Relic first. Once you're logged in, follow the instructions or use our launcher to get data flowing in. Review the system requirements. Read the install docs. Go directly to the New Relic UI to add Node.js data. Extend your instrumentation After installing the Node.js agent, extend your instrumentation: Extend your instrumentation Comments Customization Implement Node.js custom instrumentation. Collect custom metrics via an API call. Use our Node.js agent API to control, customize, or extend the agent's functionality. Open source telemetry To create your own integrations, use our Node Telemetry SDK. To gain visibility into your GraphQL payloads, use our Apollo Server plugin. Traces Enable distributed tracing. VM measurements Collect key metric timeslice data from the Node.js virtual machine. View detailed VM statistics in the New Relic UI. End-user activity Integrate the Node.js agent with browser monitoring. Gain visibility into user activity with browser monitoring's page load timing process. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with your Node.js agent, see our troubleshooting information: Large memory usage: If you've installed the Node.js agent and your memory usage has increased, check out these possible solutions. Troubleshooting your Node.js installation: Try these steps if you don't see any data, cannot log files, or encounter other installation problems with the Node.js agent. Troubleshooting browser instrumentation: If you encounter problems with browser data, see these additional tips for Node.js. You can also view all troubleshooting docs. If you need additional assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check the source code Our Node.js agent is open source software. You can browse the source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the node-newrelic README on GitHub.",

To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

      "body": "Depending on your user model, you have different options for adding and managing accounts and assigning users to them. We have two models: New Relic One user model Original user model Important Note that the user model is not directly related to our two pricing plans. New Relic One user model Important This section is about organizations on the New Relic One user model, not the original model. Learn more about the difference. At New Relic, an \"organization\" represents a New Relic customer. The organization contains everything relevant to a New Relic customer: its accounts, its users, and its data. A New Relic \"account\" can be considered a workspace. For example, you might have an account for a specific app, or a set of related hosts and services for a specific initiative or project, or you might have an account for a specific team. Each account has its own account ID, and that ID is used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls. Our Standard Full Stack Observability edition allows for a single account per organization. Pro and Enterprise editions allow for multiple accounts per organization. Currently you can't add accounts to your organization on your own. To add accounts, talk to your New Relic account representative. How users access accounts In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users’ access to accounts, you create access grants, which assign a group of users to a specific role on a specific account. For example, you may assign a user group the ability to manage billing on some accounts with the Billing manager role, and assign some users as non-admin full users on some accounts, and assign some users as basic users on some accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that’s a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. Learn more about user management. Note that some features, like dashboards and workloads, can display data from across different accounts in an organization. This means that if a user isn’t granted access to all relevant accounts, they may experience missing data. To learn more about access issues, see Factors affecting access.

If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).)

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, defined as users with access to Full Stack Observability features. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "New Relic lets you set up automated user management (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from an identity provider, like Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin. Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Benefits Before reading the benefits of automated user management, we recommend reading Get started with SAML SSO and SCIM. Benefits of enabling automated user management include: Time and cost efficiency: When you make changes in your identity provider, such as creating, updating, and removing users, these changes are automatically reflected in New Relic. By being able to manage a large set of users from your identity provider, it reduces the workload of your admins who'd otherwise need to do a significant amount of work in New Relic to accomplish the same thing. Increased productivity: By having a more automatic way to set up users and groups, they're enabled and ready to use New Relic more quickly. Enhanced security: SCIM is an industry standard protocol for maintaining groups of users. Use of this feature requires SAML SSO, so once your users are added to New Relic, they can log in using your identity provider. Popular identity providers Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin have dedicated New Relic apps, improving ease of enablement. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature requires you to be on our New Relic One user model and creates users on that model. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Configuring AUM requires that a user have the Authentication domain manager and the Organization manager role (users in the default group Admin have these). Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. There are three identity providers that have a dedicated New Relic app: Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin. For other identity providers, you can use our SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Set up automated user management (AUM) For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: Use the authentication domain UI to enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. See the SCIM API tutorial for all the steps involved. Highly recommended: Set a time zone for your users in your identity provider. How you do this will vary by identity provider. If not set in your identity provider, our UI shows UTC time zone dates/times. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). If you have issues, contact your account representative. After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic. To learn more about New Relic's roles and capabilities, see Standard roles.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user is considered a full user and has full user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Manage user type If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, the count of your full users is a billing factor. To change some of your users to free basic users, you have two choices: Manage user type from New Relic using the User management UI, OR Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below (except for the variable name, which is created automatically). The only two fields that must match exactly are External name and External namespace. The value for External namespace must be urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user and Full user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Use the Logs UI at one.newrelic.com or our EU region data center (if available) at one.eu.newrelic.com/ to: Spot interesting or significant patterns in your logs. Examine more context around a particular log line. Explore and manipulate your logging data with filters and parsing rules. Query and share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. Organize your account's log data, and optimize query performance with data partitions. Set up alert conditions for problems you want to prevent. To stay up to date with new capabilities and improvements, subscribe to our RSS feed for Logs release notes. Explore your log data Use the left nav in the Logs UI as an easy workflow through all logs, patterns, live-tail logging, and queries. Get more details about specific logs and their attributes from the center nav. To explore your logging data, follow this basic workflow. If you have not customized your New Relic One navigation bar, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data and select Logs. Look for patterns: To spot suspicious spikes or drops in log messages, click the patterns icon on the left nav. To look at logs for a specific time period, click that point (or click and drag an area) on the chart, or use the time picker. Narrow your focus: To narrow the focus of your initial search results or quickly find outliers, expand any attributes in the log details to view the ten most common values within the results. For example, if a host listed under the hostname attribute is generating significantly more error messages than the others, select that value to apply it to your search. To make your log messages easier to query and understand, use our built-in parsing rules, or create your own parsing rules for attributes that match a particular value. To manage the amount of log data collected and to store fewer logs, create drop filter rules that avoid collecting data you don't need. Examine log details: Select a log message to view its details as a table of attributes or as JSON. To see which attributes are included in a log message, click the log line. Add or remove attributes as needed to help your query focus on the details you need. To help troubleshoot problems related to a specific value in the log details, click the Show surrounding logs icon for the attribute's details. To control which attributes appear in the results, click any highlighted value in the log's log_summary column. Search: By default, the Logs UI shows all your logs, but you can also search with keywords or phrases to find the results you want; for example, process failed. OR From the search field, use the type-ahead dropdowns to select an attribute, operator, and value; for example: service_name equals my service Copy For more information, see the Logs query syntax documentation. Tip To organize data within an account and to optimize query performance, create data partition rules. Get related logs: For example: To immediately see how your system responds to deployments or other app changes, enable live-tail logging. To view all the logs for a specific value, review the attributes list in the selected log's Log details. To help identify an issue's root cause before it occurred or its impact after an event, click the Show surrounding logs icon. Share your findings: Use any of the core New Relic One functions (specific account, time range, data explorer, query builder, etc.) to share the data with charts, add to dashboards, etc. For more information, see the examples in this document. Save your views You can save your logs query, table configuration, time range, and attribute grouping in a saved view, so that you can quickly return to it later. To save a log analytics view after you've configured the view: Click the Saved Views tab in the Logs UI left nav. Click Save current view. Give your saved view the name you want for it to be listed in the Saved Views tab. Select which aspects from the current view you want to save. Select the permission level: Private, Public (Read-only), and Public (Read and write). Public means that any user with access to the account is able to see the saved view. Click Save view. Examples Here are a few examples of how you can use the Logs UI to get detailed information. To use some of these examples, you must be able to see logs in context. Create an alert from log data You can create alert conditions directly in the Logs UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results that you want to alert on; for example, service_name:\"your service\" \"fatal error\". From the Manage data section on the left nav, click Create alert condition. Complete the Create an alert condition section that slides out, then review the NRQL query that will power the alert condition. After you save the Logs alert condition, you can view it in the Alerts UI, where you can make additional changes as needed. Add log volume chart to a dashboard You can add log charts to a dashboard directly from the Logs UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Logs. Search for results you want to plot; for example, service_name:\"checkout service\" \"process failed\". OR Select a saved view. Click Add to dashboard, then fill out the details to add to an existing or new dashboard. You can also create charts with the data explorer or the query builder in New Relic One. Troubleshoot an error (logs in context) To troubleshoot errors this way, you must be able to see [logs in context] /docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/). Then, to have a better understanding of what was happening on the host at the time an error occurred in your app: Go to APM > (select an app) > Events > Error analytics and select an error trace. From the error trace Details, click See logs. From the Logs UI, browse the related log details. To identify the host generating the error, click Show surrounding logs. Troubleshoot latency (logs in context) To troubleshoot latency this way, you must be able to see logs in context. Then, to have a better understanding of how your systems were operating when performance noticeably slowed: Go to one.newrelic.com > Distributed tracing. Select a particularly slow trace. From the trace Details, click See logs for this trace. Browse related logs in the Logs UI. Links to logs in New Relic Depending on your New Relic subscription, you can access your logs from several places in the New Relic UI.

If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account.

Supported languages for both New Relic and RightScale include Java, Ruby, .NET, PHP, and Python. In order to use New Relic through the RightScale partnership, you need a New Relic account. Before getting started, be sure to enable API access. Add New Relic RightScripts Before you can view data from New Relic in RightScale, add the appropriate New Relic RightScript to your ServerTemplates: From RightCloud, select Design > MultiCloud Marketplace > ServerTemplates. Import the New Relic Performance Monitoring Toolbox ServerTemplate into your Local view. After you import the ServerTemplate, you can use the associated New Relic RightScripts with your account and add them to your ServerTemplates as appropriate for your agent language. New Relic RightScript Notes Java Tomcat For use with Tomcat5 and Tomcat6 ServerTemplates. Installs our Java agent and configures it for use with Tomcat with APM. .NET Installs and configures the New Relic agent to monitor .NET applications. Using New Relic for .NET requires .NET 3.5 or higher on the target host. (If you have only 4.0 or higher installed, you must have .NET Version 3.5 installed on the target host.) With the 3.5 framework, New Relic instruments applications targeting .NET frameworks 2.0 or higher running on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Azure. PHP Installs and configures the New Relic PHP agent and a local proxy daemon. New Relic supports PHP versions 5.2 or higher on Apache 2.2 or 2.4. Python To install and configure the New Relic Python agent, do not use RightScripts. Instead, send an email to rightscale@newrelic.com. Ruby To use the New Relic agent for your Ruby on Rails application, see New Relic for Ruby. Example PHP RightScript installation Here is an example of adding the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScripts to a PHP application server. Add the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScript as a boot script to the ServerTemplate that is being used to run your PHP application servers. This will automatically deploy the New Relic agent when a new server is launched with that ServerTemplate. If your PHP application is already running on a server, you can add it as an operational script under the Scripts tab, and run the action on the running server. Be sure to define the following input value for the new script: NR_License_Key: Enter your New Relic license key. Copy You can either manually enter the license key or create a credential for it. View APM monitoring data When viewing the data that New Relic monitors, you will only see the names of the applications that are on servers where you have run the New Relic RightScript. A host is a server and an instance is an instance of an application. RightScale users: Example of apps you can view in New Relic. To view your New Relic data: Go to Reports > New Relic. From the list of application(s) in your New Relic RightScript deployment, select an application name. On your first login, be sure to change your password: From the (account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select User preferences. Use the New Relic menu options to view different performance data and charts. Upgrade your New Relic subscription For RightScale customers, all new accounts start with a free 14-day trial of New Relic's paid subscription features.

To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account.

Import the New Relic Performance Monitoring Toolbox ServerTemplate into your Local view. After you import the ServerTemplate, you can use the associated New Relic RightScripts with your account and add them to your ServerTemplates as appropriate for your agent language. New Relic RightScript Notes Java Tomcat For use with Tomcat5 and Tomcat6 ServerTemplates. Installs our Java agent and configures it for use with Tomcat with APM. .NET Installs and configures the New Relic agent to monitor .NET applications. Using New Relic for .NET requires .NET 3.5 or higher on the target host. (If you have only 4.0 or higher installed, you must have .NET Version 3.5 installed on the target host.) With the 3.5 framework, New Relic instruments applications targeting .NET frameworks 2.0 or higher running on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Azure. PHP Installs and configures the New Relic PHP agent and a local proxy daemon. New Relic supports PHP versions 5.2 or higher on Apache 2.2 or 2.4. Python To install and configure the New Relic Python agent, do not use RightScripts. Instead, send an email to rightscale@newrelic.com. Ruby To use the New Relic agent for your Ruby on Rails application, see New Relic for Ruby. Example PHP RightScript installation Here is an example of adding the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScripts to a PHP application server. Add the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScript as a boot script to the ServerTemplate that is being used to run your PHP application servers. This will automatically deploy the New Relic agent when a new server is launched with that ServerTemplate. If your PHP application is already running on a server, you can add it as an operational script under the Scripts tab, and run the action on the running server. Be sure to define the following input value for the new script: NR_License_Key: Enter your New Relic license key. Copy You can either manually enter the license key or create a credential for it. View APM monitoring data When viewing the data that New Relic monitors, you will only see the names of the applications that are on servers where you have run the New Relic RightScript. A host is a server and an instance is an instance of an application. RightScale users: Example of apps you can view in New Relic. To view your New Relic data: Go to Reports > New Relic. From the list of application(s) in your New Relic RightScript deployment, select an application name. On your first login, be sure to change your password: From the (account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select User preferences. Use the New Relic menu options to view different performance data and charts.

If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

Supported languages for both New Relic and RightScale include Java, Ruby, .NET, PHP, and Python. In order to use New Relic through the RightScale partnership, you need a New Relic account. Before getting started, be sure to enable API access. Add New Relic RightScripts Before you can view data from New Relic in RightScale, add the appropriate New Relic RightScript to your ServerTemplates: From RightCloud, select Design > MultiCloud Marketplace > ServerTemplates. Import the New Relic Performance Monitoring Toolbox ServerTemplate into your Local view. After you import the ServerTemplate, you can use the associated New Relic RightScripts with your account and add them to your ServerTemplates as appropriate for your agent language. New Relic RightScript Notes Java Tomcat For use with Tomcat5 and Tomcat6 ServerTemplates. Installs our Java agent and configures it for use with Tomcat with APM. .NET Installs and configures the New Relic agent to monitor .NET applications. Using New Relic for .NET requires .NET 3.5 or higher on the target host. (If you have only 4.0 or higher installed, you must have .NET Version 3.5 installed on the target host.) With the 3.5 framework, New Relic instruments applications targeting .NET frameworks 2.0 or higher running on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Azure. PHP Installs and configures the New Relic PHP agent and a local proxy daemon. New Relic supports PHP versions 5.2 or higher on Apache 2.2 or 2.4. Python To install and configure the New Relic Python agent, do not use RightScripts. Instead, send an email to rightscale@newrelic.com. Ruby To use the New Relic agent for your Ruby on Rails application, see New Relic for Ruby. Example PHP RightScript installation Here is an example of adding the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScripts to a PHP application server. Add the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScript as a boot script to the ServerTemplate that is being used to run your PHP application servers. This will automatically deploy the New Relic agent when a new server is launched with that ServerTemplate. If your PHP application is already running on a server, you can add it as an operational script under the Scripts tab, and run the action on the running server. Be sure to define the following input value for the new script: NR_License_Key: Enter your New Relic license key. Copy You can either manually enter the license key or create a credential for it. View APM monitoring data When viewing the data that New Relic monitors, you will only see the names of the applications that are on servers where you have run the New Relic RightScript. A host is a server and an instance is an instance of an application. RightScale users: Example of apps you can view in New Relic. To view your New Relic data: Go to Reports > New Relic. From the list of application(s) in your New Relic RightScript deployment, select an application name. On your first login, be sure to change your password: From the (account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select User preferences.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account.

Installs our Java agent and configures it for use with Tomcat with APM. .NET Installs and configures the New Relic agent to monitor .NET applications. Using New Relic for .NET requires .NET 3.5 or higher on the target host. (If you have only 4.0 or higher installed, you must have .NET Version 3.5 installed on the target host.) With the 3.5 framework, New Relic instruments applications targeting .NET frameworks 2.0 or higher running on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows Azure. PHP Installs and configures the New Relic PHP agent and a local proxy daemon. New Relic supports PHP versions 5.2 or higher on Apache 2.2 or 2.4. Python To install and configure the New Relic Python agent, do not use RightScripts. Instead, send an email to rightscale@newrelic.com. Ruby To use the New Relic agent for your Ruby on Rails application, see New Relic for Ruby. Example PHP RightScript installation Here is an example of adding the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScripts to a PHP application server. Add the APP New Relic RPM for PHP RightScript as a boot script to the ServerTemplate that is being used to run your PHP application servers. This will automatically deploy the New Relic agent when a new server is launched with that ServerTemplate. If your PHP application is already running on a server, you can add it as an operational script under the Scripts tab, and run the action on the running server. Be sure to define the following input value for the new script: NR_License_Key: Enter your New Relic license key. Copy You can either manually enter the license key or create a credential for it. View APM monitoring data When viewing the data that New Relic monitors, you will only see the names of the applications that are on servers where you have run the New Relic RightScript. A host is a server and an instance is an instance of an application. RightScale users: Example of apps you can view in New Relic. To view your New Relic data: Go to Reports > New Relic. From the list of application(s) in your New Relic RightScript deployment, select an application name. On your first login, be sure to change your password: From the (account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select User preferences. Use the New Relic menu options to view different performance data and charts.

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event.

When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains: How New Relic calculates billable usage for an Insights Pro subscription. Available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or in API calls. Data generation Once per day, an account with an Insights Pro subscription will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every event namespace. A NrDailyUsage event includes a count of the events under that namespace. To view the attributes for this event, see the NrDailyUsage entry in the data dictionary. Usage calculations Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Insights usage page, set the time picker to Current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. The Insights usage UI only displays paid events: these are events that count towards an Insights Pro subscription. It does not display events that are included free as part of other New Relic product subscriptions. However, you can also query the product included events. How long specific events are retained will depend on each event type's data retention period. For a list of the applicable event types, see Event namespaces. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option you select in the UI. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Event namespace The category of event governed by Insights subscription. For example: APM or Mobile error. For more information, see the list of event namespaces. Stored paid events The number of events stored that count towards an Insights Pro subscription. Events included as part of other New Relic product subscriptions are not counted. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. Event namespaces (types) An Insights Pro subscription governs the data retention of certain types of events. An event's namespace (indicated by the insightsEventNamespace attribute) corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention policy.

Use this data programmatically, using one of our APIs. For general information about how to use NRQL queries, see Introduction to usage data. Tip Insights writes usage events once per day. That is why these queries use since 24 hours ago or timeseries 1 day. Here are some NRQL query examples about usage. Stored event usage for last month This query will tell you the \"billable\" number of Insights-governed events for all accounts (parent accounts and child accounts) in the hierarchy under the account where the query is run, for the last calendar month. This number is calculated as the daily average number of stored events. SELECT rate(sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount), 1 day) AS 'Paid events' FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Current Insights usage for an account This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a specific account, broken down by event namespace. Be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in these queries with your account ID. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsEventNamespace Copy This query will tell you the total current Insights-governed event storage for a specific account, for all event namespaces: SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Copy Current Insights usage for multiple accounts This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a list of accounts by event namespace. Note that you will need to replace LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs in the query with a list of account IDs. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId IN (LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs) FACET consumingAccountId, insightsEventNamespace LIMIT 100 Copy You may need to increase the value in the limit clause to see all of the facets in this query. Events included with other New Relic products This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events that are included with other New Relic product subscriptions were stored for an account, by the product that created them, over the past seven days. Note that you will need to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in the query with your account ID. SELECT sum(insightsIncludedEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 7 days ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsNrProduct TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Retention periods by child account and event namespace This query will tell you the total, paid, and included retention periods for the different event categories associated with the various New Relic products (such as APM Transaction events), for each child account under the specified parent account ID. When creating your own NRQL queries, be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your specific account ID. SELECT latest(insightsTotalRetentionInHours)/24 AS 'Total retention, days', latest(insightsIncludedRetentionInHours)/24 AS 'Included retention, days', (latest(insightsTotalRetentionInHours) - latest(insightsIncludedRetentionInHours))/24 AS 'Paid retention, days' FROM NrDailyUsage where productLine='Insights' AND masterAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET consumingAccountId,consumingAccountName,insightsEventNamespace SINCE 1 day ago Copy Paid Insights usage by child account This query will tell you how many events under an Insights Pro subscription are being consumed by each child account for the specified parent account ID over the past seven days. When creating your own NRQL queries, be sure to replace YOUR_MASTER_ACCOUNT_ID in the query with your specific parent account ID. SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount) AS 'Paid events' from NrDailyUsage SINCE 7 days ago WHERE masterAccountId = YOUR_MASTER_ACCOUNT_ID FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account.

This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains: How New Relic calculates billable usage for an Insights Pro subscription. Available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or in API calls. Data generation Once per day, an account with an Insights Pro subscription will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every event namespace. A NrDailyUsage event includes a count of the events under that namespace. To view the attributes for this event, see the NrDailyUsage entry in the data dictionary. Usage calculations Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Insights usage page, set the time picker to Current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. The Insights usage UI only displays paid events: these are events that count towards an Insights Pro subscription. It does not display events that are included free as part of other New Relic product subscriptions. However, you can also query the product included events. How long specific events are retained will depend on each event type's data retention period. For a list of the applicable event types, see Event namespaces. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option you select in the UI. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Event namespace The category of event governed by Insights subscription. For example: APM or Mobile error. For more information, see the list of event namespaces. Stored paid events The number of events stored that count towards an Insights Pro subscription. Events included as part of other New Relic product subscriptions are not counted. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. Event namespaces (types) An Insights Pro subscription governs the data retention of certain types of events. An event's namespace (indicated by the insightsEventNamespace attribute) corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention policy.

Use this data programmatically, using one of our APIs. For general information about how to use NRQL queries, see Introduction to usage data. Tip Insights writes usage events once per day. That is why these queries use since 24 hours ago or timeseries 1 day. Here are some NRQL query examples about usage. Stored event usage for last month This query will tell you the \"billable\" number of Insights-governed events for all accounts (parent accounts and child accounts) in the hierarchy under the account where the query is run, for the last calendar month. This number is calculated as the daily average number of stored events. SELECT rate(sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount), 1 day) AS 'Paid events' FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Current Insights usage for an account This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a specific account, broken down by event namespace. Be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in these queries with your account ID. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsEventNamespace Copy This query will tell you the total current Insights-governed event storage for a specific account, for all event namespaces: SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Copy Current Insights usage for multiple accounts This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a list of accounts by event namespace. Note that you will need to replace LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs in the query with a list of account IDs. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId IN (LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs) FACET consumingAccountId, insightsEventNamespace LIMIT 100 Copy You may need to increase the value in the limit clause to see all of the facets in this query. Events included with other New Relic products This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events that are included with other New Relic product subscriptions were stored for an account, by the product that created them, over the past seven days. Note that you will need to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in the query with your account ID. SELECT sum(insightsIncludedEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 7 days ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsNrProduct TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Retention periods by child account and event namespace This query will tell you the total, paid, and included retention periods for the different event categories associated with the various New Relic products (such as APM Transaction events), for each child account under the specified parent account ID. When creating your own NRQL queries, be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID with your specific account ID.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains: How New Relic calculates billable usage for an Insights Pro subscription. Available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or in API calls. Data generation Once per day, an account with an Insights Pro subscription will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every event namespace. A NrDailyUsage event includes a count of the events under that namespace. To view the attributes for this event, see the NrDailyUsage entry in the data dictionary. Usage calculations Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Insights usage page, set the time picker to Current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. The Insights usage UI only displays paid events: these are events that count towards an Insights Pro subscription. It does not display events that are included free as part of other New Relic product subscriptions. However, you can also query the product included events. How long specific events are retained will depend on each event type's data retention period. For a list of the applicable event types, see Event namespaces. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns you see depend on the Group by option you select in the UI. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID.

Use this data programmatically, using one of our APIs. For general information about how to use NRQL queries, see Introduction to usage data. Tip Insights writes usage events once per day. That is why these queries use since 24 hours ago or timeseries 1 day. Here are some NRQL query examples about usage. Stored event usage for last month This query will tell you the \"billable\" number of Insights-governed events for all accounts (parent accounts and child accounts) in the hierarchy under the account where the query is run, for the last calendar month. This number is calculated as the daily average number of stored events. SELECT rate(sum(insightsTotalEventCount)-sum(insightsIncludedEventCount), 1 day) AS 'Paid events' FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Current Insights usage for an account This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a specific account, broken down by event namespace. Be sure to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in these queries with your account ID. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsEventNamespace Copy This query will tell you the total current Insights-governed event storage for a specific account, for all event namespaces: SELECT sum(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID Copy Current Insights usage for multiple accounts This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events are currently stored for a list of accounts by event namespace. Note that you will need to replace LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs in the query with a list of account IDs. SELECT latest(insightsTotalEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 24 hours ago WHERE consumingAccountId IN (LIST_OF_ACCOUNT_IDs) FACET consumingAccountId, insightsEventNamespace LIMIT 100 Copy You may need to increase the value in the limit clause to see all of the facets in this query. Events included with other New Relic products This query will tell you how many Insights-governed events that are included with other New Relic product subscriptions were stored for an account, by the product that created them, over the past seven days. Note that you will need to replace YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID in the query with your account ID. SELECT sum(insightsIncludedEventCount) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE 7 days ago WHERE consumingAccountId = YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID FACET insightsNrProduct TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Retention periods by child account and event namespace This query will tell you the total, paid, and included retention periods for the different event categories associated with the various New Relic products (such as APM Transaction events), for each child account under the specified parent account ID.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage.

All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "Important This doc explains how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which model you're on? See Overview of user models. With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number. To edit billing settings, use the Billing UI. Adjustments to billing settings will take effect for the next billing period. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the New Relic APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription, go to the billing UI. View or change current subscription To adjust your subscription settings, use the Billing UI. If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your usage, use the usage UI.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to the usage UI. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to the usage UI. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to the usage UI. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number. To edit billing settings, use the Billing UI. Adjustments to billing settings will take effect for the next billing period. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the New Relic APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription, go to the billing UI. View or change current subscription To adjust your subscription settings, use the Billing UI. If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your usage, use the usage UI. View or update billing information To view or update your New Relic account's billing information, see the billing UI.",

      "body": "Original pricing plan This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data. User permissions User-related settings can impact what features or data you have access to. Potential impacts include: Your user type (basic user or full user). Your assigned roles. How your user roles and permissions work depends on which user model you're on: Original user model roles New Relic One user model roles If you think your permissions are preventing you from accessing something, talk to your New Relic administrators. Account access If you're having trouble finding an account, here are some causes and solutions: If your organization has multiple accounts and you have access to those accounts, you will see an account switcher at the top left of most New Relic UI pages that will let you switch between accounts. If you're logged into New Relic but can't find an account or its data, it may be for one of these reasons: You may need to be added to that account. How you do this will depend on your user model: Original use model | New Relic One user model. You may have more than one New Relic login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI notes if you have multiple user records and gives you an option for verifying your email to see all available accounts when you log in. Other details about multiple logins: To see all your available login options the next time you log in, select Remember me when logging in. If one of your login options reads \"Original account\", that means it's a user record on our original user model. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post about multiple accounts.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "Important New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure, and this structure is primarily relevant for organizations on our original user model. Overview New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is primarily relevant for organizations on our original user model, but can apply to organizations on both models. Here are the major differences in how the parent/child structure applies to them: Original user model: Our original model makes use of a parent/child-account structure, where child accounts inherit settings from parent accounts, including rules related to user access of accounts. Our partnership accounts also use this model. If your organization is on this model, you're able to create your own children accounts. If you're on this model, continue reading below to learn how this account structure works. New Relic One user model: This is our new, improved model. While organizations on this model can have a parent/child account structure, it's no longer relevant for managing user access to accounts and is primarly used for determining account relationships for some features and for aggregating organization-level billing. For more about how accounts work for this model, see Account structure. Parent and child account hierarchy For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child-account structure, each child account is attached to a single parent account and can have multiple apps reporting to it. The parent account may also have applications reporting to it, but not all data sent from child account apps rolls up to the parent account. To learn how to switch between accounts in the UI, see Account access. To understand how parent and child accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you have a partnership account structure, see Partnership accounts. Parent accounts can have their own apps reporting data. However, an app reporting to a child account may not report data to a parent account. License keys for child accounts In a New Relic organization, your main New Relic account serves as the parent account with its own license key. Each child account has their own individual license key. Each application can use only one license key, so each application can report to only one account. Create child accounts To add accounts to your New Relic organization, you must have Pro or Enterprise edition. How to add an account depends on which user model your users are on: New Relic One user model: work with your New Relic account representative. Original user model: Follow these instructions: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. Click Add account. Type the child account name, then select Add this account. Continue with the procedures for adding users to the child account. Add users to accounts To have a New Relic organization with more than one account, you must have Pro or Enterprise edition. How to add users to a child account in your organization depends on which user model your users are on: New Relic One user model: you must create an access grant that gives users access to a specific account. To learn more, see User management concepts. Original user model: In general, permissions for a user on a parent account are automatically inherited for that user on child accounts. To add users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. From the list of child accounts, select the child account. From the child account's Active users section, select Add user, fill in the user's email, name, role, and title as appropriate, and then select Add this user. Optional: Change the Owner or Admin roles for the child account as appropriate. Set up accounts with SAML SSO How to set up SAML SSO will depend on which user model your users are on: Original user model: If you set up SAML SSO at the parent account level, your child account users will also be able to sign in using SSO. If you don't set SAML SSO at the parent level, you can set it at the child account level. However, do not set SAML SSO at both levels. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts. New Relic One user model: see SAML SSO. Update child account applications Requirements: Pro or Enterprise edition. You must be on our original user model (if you're on our New Relic One user model, to add accounts talk to your account representative). Must be Owner or Admin. When you change the app's config file to move it from one account to another, New Relic treats it as a new app in the new child account. New Relic does not move any historical data for the app. To install a new app for a child account: Make sure you have selected the parent account: From the account switcher in the top left, select the account you want. From the account dropdown on the top right, select Account settings. Follow standard procedures to install new applications. OR Change the license key in the existing application's configuration file to move it to another child account.",

      "body": "Your New Relic users can be on one of two user models: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. Important If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our original user model. For more on this, see User model changes. Overview This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including: User type (basic user versus full user) Default user groups, including Admin and User Roles and capabilities For how to add and manage users in the UI, see User management. User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. The user type (basic user or full user) determines whether a user has access to our Full Stack Observability features. A user's type is something you set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our Full-Stack Observability features and some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To view and edit the user type of your users, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. In short: basic users have access to our Telemetry Data Platform and some Applied Intelligence features, while full users have theoretical access to everything (dependent on any group-related restrictions). Another way to think about this is that full users are users with access to Full Stack Observability, which gates our more curated UI features. Features Full user Basic user Full-Stack Observability (Curated UI experiences) Application performance monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Key transaction UI Workloads UI Manage other users Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps Applied Intelligence Automatic anomaly detection Correlated alerts and events Anomaly/alert analysis Root cause details in issues Telemetry Data Platform Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query your data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications Our APIs, including NerdGraph (GraphQL) (with some restrictions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Encryption at rest Standard data retention Security and compliance Data management Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to Full Stack Observability features (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing plan require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing plan have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI To set high security in the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. If you are on our original pricing plan, only the account owner can view this option. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full user) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic user versus full user) Note that there are limits around how many times full users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. What is Superwise? Superwise now offers an integration with New Relic to help users add the state of their AI as monitored by Superwise to their centralized operational view on New Relic. Migrate Data from Superwise with New Relic Superwise’s KPI and incidents integration streamlines results of our out-of-the-box model KPIs, including drift, activity, incidents, and any custom KPI you configure, directly into New Relic One. You’ll get an immediate overview of which models are misbehaving that can be tailored to any use case, logic, segmentation, threshold, and sensitivity. In order to receive data from Superwise into New Relic, you’ll need to do the following: Login into your New Relic account: Log into one.newrelic.com and click on Explorer. On the upper hand corner, on the main navigation menu, click on + Add more data. Click on Superwise: In the search bar, type Superwise or scroll down to the MLOps Integration section, then click on the Superwise icon. Select an account ID: Select the account ID you want Superwise to integrate with. Create two access tokens: Once you select an Account ID, under Prediction data + Generate Dashboard, click Create a key. This is your new telemetry API key. In addition, under Model quality metric, click Create a Key. This is your Incident Insights key. Keep the New Relic page open for future steps. Log into the Superwise portal: Log into the Superwise portal and go to Notification channel settings. Select New Relic and create a channel name. Copy and paste the token in Superwise: Go back to the New Relic integration dashboard and copy the two tokens you created by clicking on the copy icon next to the API key and Insight key. On Superwise’s portal, on the New Relic channel, paste the API key under Incident Intelligence API, and the Insight key under Telemetry Key. Finish by clicking Save. Verify the Token: Click on the Test button in the Superwise channel portal, to verify both tokens are working properly. A green or red status box should appear to indicate the verification. View and explore your Superwise models in New Relic dashboards Once a user configures the New Relic integration in Superwise, standard model metrics are sent to New Relic and users get model observability dashboards within New Relic. Users can also configure any specific model metric and incident policy and send them to New Relic for model observability tailored to their business context. Go to the integration dashboard: Once you’ve tested your tokens and confirmed the integration is set up correctly, return to the New Relic integration dashboard and click on See your data. This will redirect you to an automatically generated dashboard powered by Superwise. Analyze Superwise’s dashboard. Superwise’s dashboard contains 3 charts: The Model activity chart displays the number of active models, their activity, and the total number of predictions during a filtered timeframe. The Model input drift detection chart displays which models are drifting and may require retraining using a model drift leveler, scaled between 0 and 100. The Incident Insights chart displays how many models have open incidents, how incidents are being distributed, and deeper details on the model incident itself. Customize metrics and incidents in Superwise: Teams can easily customize any model metric and incident type in the Superwise platform. They can then search for these metrics in the New Relic Browser tab under Metrics. To do this, follow the instructions in step 4 in the Superwise docs. Setup alert notifications: Once you've created some dashboards, you can get alerted on your data. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart widget, then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one. Get notified: Once you've created an alerts condition, you can choose how you want to be notified. See our docs on how to set up notification channels. Correlate your incidents: In addition to notifications, you can use Incident Intelligence to correlate your incidents. See our docs on how to correlate incidents using decisions. You’ve now successfully integrated New Relic with Superwise. Newly created alerts will now be correlated with your New Relic alerts and you should be able to see data about newly reported predictions.",

User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. The user type (basic user or full user) determines whether a user has access to our Full Stack Observability features. A user's type is something you set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our Full-Stack Observability features and some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To view and edit the user type of your users, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. In short: basic users have access to our Telemetry Data Platform and some Applied Intelligence features, while full users have theoretical access to everything (dependent on any group-related restrictions). Another way to think about this is that full users are users with access to Full Stack Observability, which gates our more curated UI features. Features Full user Basic user Full-Stack Observability (Curated UI experiences) Application performance monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Key transaction UI Workloads UI Manage other users Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps Applied Intelligence Automatic anomaly detection Correlated alerts and events Anomaly/alert analysis Root cause details in issues Telemetry Data Platform Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query your data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications Our APIs, including NerdGraph (GraphQL) (with some restrictions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Encryption at rest Standard data retention Security and compliance Data management Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to Full Stack Observability features (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on requirements: This tutorial is for users on our New Relic One user model. Creating access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we recommend you check out: Understand what an access grant is Videos that show the user management UI in action This tutorial will walk you through how to: Add users View available accounts Grant groups access to roles and accounts Create custom roles Add users to groups Add users Adding users to New Relic is a separate process from creating access grants. In other words, you can do either procedure first. The key point is that if you're trying to give a user access to a role or an account that they don't yet have, they won't have that access until they're both a) in a group and b) that group has the correct access grant (access to a specific role on a specific account). There are two ways to add users: With the user management UI (described below) With automated user management, also known as SCIM provisioning: use of this method means that groups are defined in your identity provider and so you can't edit a user's group from the New Relic UI. To add users from the UI: From the top right of the New Relic UI, click the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Relevant tips: For how to bulk edit users' user type, see Edit user type. When choosing a group, you can choose either one of our default groups or a custom group that you've defined an access grant for. For more on creating access grants, keep reading. View available accounts When thinking about creating access grants for granting access to different accounts, it can help you to understand what accounts there are in your organization. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant access to accounts and roles Groups are used to group your users and manage what your users are able to do in New Relic: by creating an access grant, you assign a group access to a) a specific role on b) a specific account. By default, organizations on the New Relic One user model have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. To view existing access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. Even if you haven't created any custom access grants, you will see the default-created grants there that are present for our default groups. This is what you might see when you go to the Organization and access UI and view groups. The default available groups of Admin and User have access grants automatically created that grant users in those groups access to the roles associated with those groups and to the initial account those users were added in. To create a new access grant that gives a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. If you don't see that UI, it may be because you're logged in with an original user model record, or because you don't have the ability to manage users. For more on such factors, see Factors affecting access. Choose one of the following: Existing: If there is already a group you want to add an access grant to, you can use this. For example, if you want to gives users in the default Admin or User group access to new accounts, you might choose this and then select the Admin Default or Admin User role. New: If you need to create a new group, choose this. You'll also need to choose the authentication domain that group is inside of (for an explanation of what \"Default\" means, see Default groups. If your organization strategy requires a good amount of restrictions over access to accounts and access to roles, you'll probably need to create a good amount of access grants. Next, under Access grant, you'll choose one of following: Account: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are account-scoped. These are the roles that have to do with using and configuring our platform features (and not about organization and user management). Organization: Choose this to be able to select from the roles that are organization-scoped. These are the roles that govern organization- and user management. (Note that these users must also already belong to an account-scoped role. This is true for most users but if it's not, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Select the Role you want to assign. Roles are organization-wide, so regardless of the authentication domain you're in, you have access to our standard roles and any custom roles you've created. For tips on selecting roles, see the tips after these instructions. Select the Account you want to add access to from the dropdown. If you don't see an account that you'd expect to see, this may be for a few reasons. One is that you yourself don't have the proper permissions for that account. Another is that that account is not actually in your organization. For more information, see Factors affecting access. If you are still having problems, talk to your account representative. If you want to continue adding more grants for that same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. When you're done, if your users are already in the group you've added the grant to, they should have access within a few minutes (although for EU region New Relic accounts, this can take up to twenty minutes or so). If your users are not yet in that group (which would be true if you just created an access grant with a new group), you'll need to go to the User management UI and add that group to those users. Some tips for using this UI: Note that if a user has the organization-scoped Organization manager and/or Authentication domain manager roles, which is true of users in the default Admin group, those users will always have those capabilities because those are organization-scoped abilities. This means that when you go to add those users to another account, you only have to add an account-scoped role, and not an organization-scoped role. In other words, once the users in a group have those organization-scoped roles, they will always have them in that organization unless removed. When selecting from amongst our standard roles, it's important to understand the difference between All product admin and Standard user. In short, All product admin is more popular a choice because it gives the ability to configure platform features. If you wanted to have your users be able to use platform features but not configure them, you'd choose Standard user. If your users are managed via automated user management, there are some restrictions that may apply. For example, you wouldn't be able to use the User management UI to add users to groups, because groups are managed and imported from your identity provider. If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. Create custom role When creating an access grant, you can use our standard roles, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Review the list of available capabilities and decide which ones your custom role needs. For more information about how roles and capabilities work, see Capabilities. Once you're finished creating a custom role, you will probably want to use it in a new access grant. Add users to groups In the user management UI, you can see your users and the groups they've been assigned to. Your users only have access to the access grants associated with the groups they've been added to. To view users and see their groups: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing plan, not our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation. For more help For details about the data retention of other products or integrations, see that specific documentation.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which model you're on? See Overview of user models. With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number. To edit billing settings, use the Billing UI. Adjustments to billing settings will take effect for the next billing period. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the New Relic APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription, go to the billing UI. View or change current subscription To adjust your subscription settings, use the Billing UI. If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your usage, use the usage UI.

      "body": "Original pricing plan This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

The following data retention periods exist for New Relic Plugins. Important Plugins is not supported with accounts that host data in the EU region data center. Plugins data retention Component Lite Essentials Pro Enterprise Metric data 24 hours 3 days 90 days 90 days Legacy Plugins data retention Component Standard Startup Small Business Metric data 7 days 14 days 30 days Synthetics For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Synthetics data retention policies depend on your Synthetics product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details. Browser Types of trace data: Session traces Browser traces JavaScript errors* See Browser data retention details. Mobile Types of trace data: App crash stack traces Interaction traces See Mobile data retention details. * JavaScript errors in the stack trace UI are saved as trace data. JS errors are also saved as events.",

These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our original user model. Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a SAML certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used. Requirements Requirements include: These docs apply for managing users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. Access to this feature requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Owner role required SSO settings UI page To find the New Relic SSO settings page: from the account dropdown, click Account settings, then click Security and authentication, then click Single sign on. If you don't see this UI, review the requirements. Providers supported by New Relic For a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic title bar, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. Providers include: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 SAML information in New Relic account To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic SSO settings UI page: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users on our original user model that are authenticating via SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

Architecture: C library and daemon The C SDK relies on two components to send data from your application to New Relic: The lC SDK calls: You download this library, then add the calls and instrumentation to your application's code. This allows you to identify and customize the kinds of data that matters the most to you. The C SDK daemon: This is a separate binary that accumulates data from the C SDK calls, and sends it to New Relic. This acts as a proxy between the SDK and New Relic. C SDK architecture: To send data from your application to New Relic, the daemon must be invoked before making calls to your application's C SDK instrumentation library. Working together, the C SDK instrumentation and the daemon forward data on to New Relic where you can view and query data about transactions. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: An HTTPS link is established between the daemon and New Relic. The daemon must be invoked first, before your instrumented application is invoked. Next, socket communication is established between your instrumented application and the daemon. This occurs after successful calls to newrelic_new_app_config() and newrelic_create_app(). The call to newrelic_create_app() is non-blocking. Its second parameter allows you to specify an amount of time for your instrumented application to wait so that the socket communication is adequately established. For example: newrelic_app_t* app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); Copy If your instrumented application sends transactions before both the daemon connection and your application's socket communication are established, data reported from your application will be lost.

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

Operating environments The C SDK works in 64-bit Linux operating systems with: gcc 4.8 or higher glibc 2.17 or higher Kernel version 2.6.26 or higher libpcre 8.20 or higher libpthread cmake 2.8 or higher Compiling the New Relic daemon requires Go 1.7 or higher. License key You will need a New Relic license key for the account you want to report data to. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Database and instance-level performance You can collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. You can also view slow query trace details for the following SQL-based database platforms: Firebird Informix Microsoft SQL Server MySQL Oracle Postgres SQLite Sybase",

Add C data Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors.

We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon. This only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts. To install C SDK for a container environment, we recommend installing the C SDK daemon on a separate docker container: Install the daemon by cloning the C SDK repository and building the daemon. This is done most effectively via the command make daemon. See the README.md for further details. If you are using Docker, you can use the C SDK daemon image on Dockerhub. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument.

      "body": "Our C SDK auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic C SDK installation. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Add C data Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors. If you still have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips.",

      "body": "Our C SDK auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic C SDK installation. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Add C data Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors.

Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument.

      "body": "In order to monitor any application on Linux using a language that can import C libraries, you must: Create a config using newrelic_new_app_config(), connect to the daemon using newrelic_init(), and connect your application using newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

      "body": "In order to monitor any application on Linux using a language that can import C libraries, you must: Create a config using newrelic_new_app_config(), connect to the daemon using newrelic_init(), and connect your application using newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings.

      "body": "In order to monitor any application on Linux using a language that can import C libraries, you must: Create a config using newrelic_new_app_config(), connect to the daemon using newrelic_init(), and connect your application using newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program. Report a custom performance duration that you can search or chart. newrelic_record_custom_metric() Monitor desktop browser performance To monitor desktop browser performance for your application, install the browser agent using the copy/paste method. Change configuration settings Typically the default settings for your application's configuration do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust some of the settings. For more information, see the C SDK configuration documentation.",

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic C SDK installation. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Add C data Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md.

Solution The New Relic C SDK and its daemon have their own logs: C SDK logs: These logs are generated due to errors in how you've instrumented your code using the New Relic C SDK API calls. Daemon logs: These are logs related to transmission of data to New Relic. To help troubleshoot an issue, we recommend generating logs at their highest level: Set the C SDK log to verbose level and the daemon log to debug level. Run both logs for 5-10 minutes. After generating logs for troubleshooting, return logging for both the C SDK and daemon to their default levels. Caution Elevated logging levels can create large log files and have a performance impact. Generate logs at this level only as long as necessary for troubleshooting. C SDK logs The C SDK has four log levels, as defined by the enum _newrelic_loglevel_t in libnewrelic.h. By default, logs are set to NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO and output to standard error. Log levels include: NEWRELIC_LOG_ERROR NEWRELIC_LOG_WARNING NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO (default) NEWRELIC_LOG_DEBUG Copy To set a different log level for troubleshooting purposes: Call newrelic_configure_log() in your application code, and set a log level. For example: newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO); Copy Daemon logs The C SDK daemon has four log levels. By default, logs are set to info and output to standard error. Log levels include: error warning info (default) debug Copy These log levels are invoked using flags from the command line: --logfile <DAEMON_FILE_NAME>. Sets the path to the log file. --loglevel <LOG_LEVEL>. Sets the log level. Default: info. Copy To set a different log level for troubleshooting purposes: From the command line, set a different log level flag. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, [action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire [, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, [group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, [amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end([callback]) transactionHandle.end([callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, [customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) newrelic.shutdown([options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. Option name Type Attributes Default Description collectPendingData boolean Optional false Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. collectPendingData boolean Optional false Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. timeout number Optional 0 The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. waitForIdle boolean Optional false If true, the agent will not shut down until there are no active transactions. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 10000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with a New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels = map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically NoticeError() Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events Custom attributes Custom metrics If you want to...

Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic RecordCustomEvent() Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them AddAttribute() Report custom performance data for a specified period of time RecordCustomMetric() Monitor browser performance with browser monitoring To monitor browser performance for your app using browser monitoring and the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: If you want to... Use this... Install the browser agent Use the browser copy/paste method Add the browser monitoring JavaScript code directly to HTML pages BrowserTimingHeader() Change the configuration settings for the Go agent To manage some aspects of New Relic monitoring, you can change your Go agent configuration settings; for example: Turning on high security mode Adding custom labels for filtering and sorting Managing what information is reported",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with a New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels = map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically NoticeError() Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events Custom attributes Custom metrics If you want to... Use this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic RecordCustomEvent() Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them AddAttribute() Report custom performance data for a specified period of time RecordCustomMetric() Monitor browser performance with browser monitoring To monitor browser performance for your app using browser monitoring and the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: If you want to... Use this... Install the browser agent Use the browser copy/paste method Add the browser monitoring JavaScript code directly to HTML pages BrowserTimingHeader() Change the configuration settings for the Go agent To manage some aspects of New Relic monitoring, you can change your Go agent configuration settings; for example: Turning on high security mode Adding custom labels for filtering and sorting Managing what information is reported",

      "body": "The Go agent supports cross application tracing (CAT). Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture. Important Distributed tracing is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Enable cross application tracing with Go You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled configuration flag. Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or creating its own transactions. Creating transactions via http.ServeMux If you're using Go's http.ServeMux and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct CAT headers. Your code should look similar to the following: http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", usersHandler) http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy You can read more about these wrappers in Instrument Go transactions. Creating web transactions manually When creating your own transactions with app.StartTransaction, ensure that you also call Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled: txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req) // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(500) defer txn.End() Copy However, a transaction started without the calls to Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse will not have CAT enabled: // Cross application tracing not enabled txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") defer txn.End() Copy Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's txn.WriteHeader method rather than the standard library's http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader method. // old code // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) // replace with this txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") txn.SetWebRequest(req) writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) Copy Making HTTP requests In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to create an external segment. The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the newrelic.NewRoundTripper method. For example, this code will make a request to http://api.example.com/ that includes the outgoing CAT headers. func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) { client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://api.example.com/\", nil) req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn) return client.Do(req) } Copy If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's http.Request, you'll need to use the newrelic.StartExternalSegment method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy While it's also possible to create an ExternalSegment via a struct literal, this segment will not be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelic.ExternalSegment. func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) { // CAT headers not inserted defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), URL: url, }.End() return http.Get(url) } Copy Get distributed tracing New Relic also offers distributed tracing.

Therefore the v3.x agents will produce two attributes representing the response status code for a web request. To completely exclude the attribute when using the v3.x agent, you must include both the old and new attributes. For example: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCode, newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated, ) Copy Span and segment attributes If you have Go agent v2.6.0 or higher, you can configure attributes on spans and segments. The Go agent receives the following default attributes from your app. These attributes are only found on span events and transaction trace segments. You can adjust these default settings and turn attributes on or off for certain destinations. db.collection For datastore segments, this is the collection used and represents the table or group, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBCollection. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBCollection) Copy db.instance For datastore segments this is the database name and represents the name of the database where the query is being executed, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBInstance.

      "body": "With New Relic for Go, you can monitor the specific segments of a transaction in a Go application to get more detail about specific functions or code blocks. Measure time for functions and code blocks Segments are the specific parts of a transaction in an application. By instrumenting segments, you can measure the time taken by functions and code blocks, such as external calls, datastore calls, adding messages to queues, and background tasks. Example: You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You could instrument your application to break that transaction up into two pieces: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. Block-of-code segments Once you instrument a transaction, you are ready to instrument one or more segments in that transaction. To instrument an arbitrary block of code as a segment, use the following pattern, and include txn as the variable name set for the transaction: segment := newrelic.Segment{} segment.Name = \"mySegmentName\" segment.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... code you want to time here ... segment.End() Copy StartSegment is a convenient helper. It creates a segment and starts it: segment := txn.StartSegment(\"mySegmentName\") // ... code you want to time here ... segment.End() Copy Function segments Instrumenting a function as a segment is essentially the same as instrumenting an arbitrary block of code as a segment. The main difference is that, because a function has a discrete ending, you can use Go's defer statement. To instrument a function as a segment, add the following code at the start of the function, and include txn as the variable name set for the transaction: defer txn.StartSegment(\"mySegmentName\").End() Copy Nest segments Segments can be nested. The segment being ended must be the most recently started segment. Here's an example of a segment starting and ending inside another segment: s1 := txn.StartSegment(\"outerSegment\") s2 := txn.StartSegment(\"innerSegment\") // s2 must end before s1 s2.End() s1.End() Copy A zero value segment may safely be ended. Therefore, the following code is safe even if the conditional fails: var s newrelic.Segment if recordSegment { s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow(), } // ... code you wish to time here ... s.End() Copy Datastore segments You can instrument Go application datastore calls. Datastore segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown table and Databases tab of the Transactions page in New Relic. If you are using a MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite database driver, the easiest way to add Datastore segments is to use our pre-built integration packages. Otherwise, you can manually create Datastore segments for each database call. Use instrumentation package There is an integration package for each database driver that we support: Database library supported Integration package go-sql-driver/mysql v3/integrations/nrmysql lib/pq v3/integrations/nrpq mattn/go-sqlite3 v3/integrations/nrsqlite3 To use one of these integrations, first replace the driver with our integration version: import ( // import our integration package in place of \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\" _ \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrmysql\" ) func main() { // open \"nrmysql\" in place of \"mysql\" db, err := sql.Open(\"nrmysql\", \"user@unix(/path/to/socket)/dbname\") } Copy Second, use the ExecContext, QueryContext, and QueryRowContext methods of sql.DB, sql.Conn, sql.Tx, and sql.Stmt and provide a transaction-containing context. Calls to Exec, Query, and QueryRow do not get instrumented. ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn) row := db.QueryRowContext(ctx, \"SELECT count(*) from tables\") Copy If you are using a database/sql database not listed above, you can write your own instrumentation for it using InstrumentConnector, InstrumentDriver, and DriverSegmentBuilder. The integration packages act as examples of how to do this. Important Datastore integration packages for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite were added in Go Agent v2.8.0 and require Go v1.10 or above. Use DatastoreSegment Just like basic segments, datastore segments begin when the StartTime field is populated and finish when the End method is called. To instrument a datastore segment, place the following at the beginning of the function you want to monitor: s := newrelic.DatastoreSegment{ Product: newrelic.DatastoreMySQL, Collection: \"users\", Operation: \"INSERT\", ParameterizedQuery: \"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)\", QueryParameters: map[string]interface{}{ \"name\": \"Dracula\", \"age\": 439, }, Host: \"mysql-server-1\", PortPathOrID: \"3306\", DatabaseName: \"my_database\", } s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... make the datastore call s.End() Copy For more information about: Assigning the Collection, Operation, DatabaseName, and other parameter values: See the New Relic datastore segment documentation on GoDoc. Available values for Product: See the New Relic documentation on GitHub. When instrumenting a datastore call that spans an entire function call, you can use the defer statement to simplify instrumentation: s := newrelic.DatastoreSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), Product: newrelic.DatastoreMySQL, Collection: \"users\", Operation: \"INSERT\", ParameterizedQuery: \"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)\", QueryParameters: map[string]interface{}{ \"name\": \"Dracula\", \"age\": 439, }, Host: \"mysql-server-1\", PortPathOrID: \"3306\", DatabaseName: \"my_database\", } defer s.End() Copy External segments You can instrument Go application calls to external services, such as web services, resources in the cloud, and any other network calls. External segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown table and the External services page in New Relic. There are two ways to instrument external segments: Use StartExternalSegment() Recommendation: Use the StartExternalSegment helper, since New Relic uses it to trace activity between your applications using cross application tracing. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy Use NewRoundTripper() NewRoundTripper returns an http.RoundTripper, which allows you to instrument external calls without calling StartExternalSegment by modifying your http.Client's Transport field. The RoundTripper returned will look for a Transaction in the request's context using FromContext. Here is an example of NewRoundTripper instrumentation: client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://example.com\", nil) request = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(request, txn) response, err := client.Do(request) Copy Message producer segments You can instrument Go application calls that add messages to queuing systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka. Message producer segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown in New Relic. There is only one way to instrument message producer segments: Use MessageProducerSegment Just like basic segments, message producer segments begin when the StartTime field is populated, and finish when the End method is called. To instrument a message producer segment, place the following at the beginning of the function you want to monitor: s := newrelic.MessageProducerSegment{ Library: \"RabbitMQ\", DestinationType: newrelic.MessageExchange, DestinationName: \"myExchange\", DestinationTemporary: false, } s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... add message to queue s.End() Copy For more information about assigning the Library, DestinationType, DestinationName, or DestinationTemporary fields, see the New Relic message producer segment documentation on GoDoc. When instrumenting a message producer call that spans an entire function call, you can use the defer statement to simplify instrumentation: s := newrelic.MessageProducerSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), Library: \"RabbitMQ\", DestinationType: newrelic.MessageExchange, DestinationName: \"myExchange\", DestinationTemporary: false, } defer s.End() // ... add message to queue Copy Important Message producer segments were added in Go Agent version 2.14.0.",

      "body": "Custom metrics allow you to report any metric that passes through your code. For example, with New Relic's Go monitoring, you can create custom metrics to time a component of your app that may not captured by default. Once you capture a custom metric, you can: Unify your monitoring inside New Relic through the data explorer. Use our REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the UI. Create custom metric alert conditions to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Create a custom metric Instantiate your application by running the following: cfg := newrelic.NewConfig(\"Your App Name\", mustGetEnv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")) cfg.Logger = newrelic.NewDebugLogger(os.Stdout) var err error app, err = newrelic.NewApplication(cfg) Copy After instantiating your app, create a custom metric with the following code: app.RecordCustomMetric( \"CustomMetricName\", //name of your metric 132, //time in ms ); Copy RecordCustomMetric's first parameter is a string that names your custom metric. The RecordCustomMetric method will automatically prepend the string Custom/ to your metric name. This means the above code will generate a metric named Custom/CustomMetricName. RecordCustomMetric's second parameter is the time, in milliseconds, that you want to record for your custom transaction. This means the above code will produce a metric of .132 seconds in New Relic's systems. To use a custom metric as a counter, it can be incremented by making the call as described above, and the count value for that metric will be incremented by 1. The value you use for the second parameter (time in ms) is irrelevant if you are only using the metric as a counter, and thus you can use a static number, such as 0 or 1. To increment a counter by a number greater than 1, call app.RecordCustomMetric multiple times - each call will only increment the metric by 1 no matter what the value of the second parameter is. Name a custom metric Carefully consider how you name your custom metrics. If your program creates too many uniquely-named metrics, you may end up with a metric grouping issue (MGI). MGIs occur when the granularity of metric names is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different metric names. One common cause of MGIs is relying on the full URL name for metric naming in web transactions. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, page, etc. If the unique element of the URL path is included in the metric name, each of these common paths will have its own unique metric name. If metric grouping issues occur, follow the troubleshooting procedures.

      "body": "The Go agent supports cross application tracing (CAT). Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture. Important Distributed tracing is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Enable cross application tracing with Go You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled configuration flag. Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or creating its own transactions. Creating transactions via http.ServeMux If you're using Go's http.ServeMux and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct CAT headers. Your code should look similar to the following: http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", usersHandler) http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy You can read more about these wrappers in Instrument Go transactions. Creating web transactions manually When creating your own transactions with app.StartTransaction, ensure that you also call Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled: txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req) // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(500) defer txn.End() Copy However, a transaction started without the calls to Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse will not have CAT enabled: // Cross application tracing not enabled txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") defer txn.End() Copy Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's txn.WriteHeader method rather than the standard library's http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader method. // old code // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) // replace with this txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") txn.SetWebRequest(req) writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) Copy Making HTTP requests In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to create an external segment. The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the newrelic.NewRoundTripper method. For example, this code will make a request to http://api.example.com/ that includes the outgoing CAT headers. func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) { client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://api.example.com/\", nil) req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn) return client.Do(req) } Copy If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's http.Request, you'll need to use the newrelic.StartExternalSegment method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy While it's also possible to create an ExternalSegment via a struct literal, this segment will not be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelic.ExternalSegment. func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) { // CAT headers not inserted defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), URL: url, }.End() return http.Get(url) } Copy Get distributed tracing New Relic also offers distributed tracing.

      "body": "The Go agent supports cross application tracing (CAT). Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture. Important Distributed tracing is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Enable cross application tracing with Go You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled configuration flag. Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or creating its own transactions. Creating transactions via http.ServeMux If you're using Go's http.ServeMux and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct CAT headers. Your code should look similar to the following: http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", usersHandler) http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy You can read more about these wrappers in Instrument Go transactions. Creating web transactions manually When creating your own transactions with app.StartTransaction, ensure that you also call Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled: txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req) // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(500) defer txn.End() Copy However, a transaction started without the calls to Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse will not have CAT enabled: // Cross application tracing not enabled txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") defer txn.End() Copy Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's txn.WriteHeader method rather than the standard library's http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader method. // old code // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) // replace with this txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") txn.SetWebRequest(req) writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) Copy Making HTTP requests In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to create an external segment. The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the newrelic.NewRoundTripper method. For example, this code will make a request to http://api.example.com/ that includes the outgoing CAT headers. func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) { client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://api.example.com/\", nil) req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn) return client.Do(req) } Copy If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's http.Request, you'll need to use the newrelic.StartExternalSegment method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy While it's also possible to create an ExternalSegment via a struct literal, this segment will not be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelic.ExternalSegment. func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) { // CAT headers not inserted defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), URL: url, }.End() return http.Get(url) } Copy Get distributed tracing New Relic also offers distributed tracing.

You can also use your data to improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions. Go is a compiled language, and doesn’t use a virtual machine. The best way to monitor Go applications is to use the Go API. Our API provides exceptional flexibility and control over what gets instrumented. Get New Relic for Go in a few simple steps. Monitor application and microservice performance The Go programming language, also called Golang, has become a popular coding choice for its ease of use, concurrency, and impressive speed. With New Relic for Go, you will gain a new level of visibility into your Golang applications: See the big picture: Monitor the throughput, response times, and errors of the transactions in your applications and services. Understand your application's runtime health by seeing memory usage, garbage collection behavior, and CPU usage over time. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. Use distributed tracing to understand how your services and microservices are interacting. Identify and fix errors: Find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. View Goroutine counts and identify possible Goroutine leaks. Get alerts for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Analyze business data: Query user-related data and improve business processes. Create custom queries of your Go application data. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. Get New Relic for Go To use New Relic for Go: Check the compatibility and requirements. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. To install the agent, use our launcher, or follow the New Relic Go agent's installation and instrumentation procedures. Wait a few minutes to view data from your Go app in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add Go data We recommend instrumenting your Go code to get the maximum benefits from the New Relic Go agent. But we make it easy to get great data in couple of ways: Simply import the agent and create an application to get useful runtime information about your number of goroutines, garbage collection statistics, and memory and CPU usage. Use our many integration packages for out-of-the box support for many popular Go web frameworks and libraries. We continue to add integration packages based on your feedback. You can weigh in on potential integrations on the Explorers Hub and our New Relic Go agent GitHub project. Additional instrumentation After installing the agent, consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter OpenTelemetry exporter Go Telemetry SDK Check the source code The Go agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

Custom metrics: Record additional metrics as part of a transaction to gain more insights into your app's performance and business data. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with the Ruby agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic for Go monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also use your data to improve your customers' experience and make data-driven business decisions. Go is a compiled language, and doesn’t use a virtual machine. The best way to monitor Go applications is to use the Go API. Our API provides exceptional flexibility and control over what gets instrumented. Get New Relic for Go in a few simple steps. Monitor application and microservice performance The Go programming language, also called Golang, has become a popular coding choice for its ease of use, concurrency, and impressive speed. With New Relic for Go, you will gain a new level of visibility into your Golang applications: See the big picture: Monitor the throughput, response times, and errors of the transactions in your applications and services. Understand your application's runtime health by seeing memory usage, garbage collection behavior, and CPU usage over time. With deployment markers, see how code changes impact application performance and health. Use infrastructure monitoring to view detailed host and server data. Use distributed tracing to understand how your services and microservices are interacting. Identify and fix errors: Find bottlenecks by seeing time spent on database calls, external system calls, and key blocks of code. View Goroutine counts and identify possible Goroutine leaks. Get alerts for problems or errors before they affect users. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Analyze business data: Query user-related data and improve business processes. Create custom queries of your Go application data. Send your own custom data to New Relic. Create and share visual, interactive displays of your data. Get New Relic for Go To use New Relic for Go: Check the compatibility and requirements. If you do not already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. To install the agent, use our launcher, or follow the New Relic Go agent's installation and instrumentation procedures. Wait a few minutes to view data from your Go app in your New Relic account's UI. Read the install docs Add Go data We recommend instrumenting your Go code to get the maximum benefits from the New Relic Go agent. But we make it easy to get great data in couple of ways: Simply import the agent and create an application to get useful runtime information about your number of goroutines, garbage collection statistics, and memory and CPU usage. Use our many integration packages for out-of-the box support for many popular Go web frameworks and libraries. We continue to add integration packages based on your feedback. You can weigh in on potential integrations on the Explorers Hub and our New Relic Go agent GitHub project. Additional instrumentation After installing the agent, consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter OpenTelemetry exporter Go Telemetry SDK Check the source code The Go agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Go agent sends default events and attributes to New Relic for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction. Browser monitoring The Go agent has an API for returning the browser agent's JavaScript.

Install New Relic Infrastructure and view detailed host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly Track key transactions. Create customized dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users. Track performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Monitor Ruby background processes and daemons. Analyze business data Use the Ruby agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own. Query your data using NRQL. Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the agent After creating a New Relic account, use our launcher or see the installation instructions. Install docs for gem (recommended) Install docs for rails plugin Add Ruby data Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Automatically inject the browser monitoring agent to get visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to fully customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom metrics: Record additional metrics as part of a transaction to gain more insights into your app's performance and business data. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with the Ruby agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with a New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels = map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "With our Go agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Go agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy",

      "body": "With our Go agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. Here we explain how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and give an example of deploying a Go app with Docker. Important The Go agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the Go agent, building a custom Go runtime for Docker, and deploying a golang application. For more information about deploying and configuring your Go app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Go Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Go app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Go agent for your specific app server, including your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Go to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, download and install git, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy 3. Configure a Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. The following Dockerfile example code defines the golang version used. FROM golang:1.8-onbuild CMD go run main.go Copy 4. Build a Docker image To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project go-app-name app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see GAE's documentation for debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Go agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy",

Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeHostDisplayName) Copy httpResponseCode The response status code for a web request, called with newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated) Copy Important As of Go agent v3.0.0, this attribute has been marked deprecated and been renamed to http.statusCode. The v3.x agent will continue to produce this attribute, but it will be removed in v4.0.0. request.headers.accept The type as read from the HTTP request's Accept header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestAccept Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestAccept) Copy request.headers.contentLength The incoming request size in bytes as read from the Content-Length request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestContentLength. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestContentLength) Copy request.headers.contentType The incoming request content type as read from the Content-Type request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestContentType. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestContentType) Copy request.headers.host The name from the HTTP host request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestHost. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestHost) Copy request.headers.referer The incoming request referer as read from the Referer request header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestReferer. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestReferer) Copy request.headers.User-Agent The contents of the User-Agent HTTP header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgentDeprecated Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgentDeprecated) Copy Important As of Go agent v3.0.0, this attribute has been marked deprecated and been renamed to request.headers.userAgent. The v3.x agent will continue to produce this attribute, but it will be removed in v4.0.0. request.headers.userAgent The contents of the User-Agent HTTP header, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgent Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Disabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgent) Copy Important This attribute was added in v3.0.0 of the agent and the original request.headers.User-Agent will eventually be removed. Therefore the v3.x agents will produce two attributes representing the the contents of the User-Agent HTTP header. To completely exclude the attribute when using the v3.x agent, you must include both the old and new attributes. For example: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgent, newrelic.AttributeRequestUserAgentDeprecated, ) Copy request.method The HTTP method of the incoming request, called with newrelic.AttributeRequestMethod Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeRequestMethod) Copy response.headers.contentLength The outgoing response size in bytes as read from the Content-Length response header, called with newrelic.AttributeResponseContentLength. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseContentLength) Copy response.headers.contentType The outgoing response content-type as read from the Content-Type response header, called with newrelic.AttributeResponseContentType. Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseContentType) Copy http.statusCode The response status code for a web request, called with newrelic.AttributeResponseCode Default settings: Transaction traces: Enabled Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCode) Copy Important This attribute was added in v3.0.0 of the agent and the original httpResponseCode will eventually be removed. Therefore the v3.x agents will produce two attributes representing the response status code for a web request. To completely exclude the attribute when using the v3.x agent, you must include both the old and new attributes. For example: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCode, newrelic.AttributeResponseCodeDeprecated, ) Copy Span and segment attributes If you have Go agent v2.6.0 or higher, you can configure attributes on spans and segments. The Go agent receives the following default attributes from your app. These attributes are only found on span events and transaction trace segments. You can adjust these default settings and turn attributes on or off for certain destinations. db.collection For datastore segments, this is the collection used and represents the table or group, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBCollection. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBCollection) Copy db.instance For datastore segments this is the database name and represents the name of the database where the query is being executed, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBInstance. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBInstance) Copy db.statement For datastore segments this is the parameterized query being executed and represents the query being performed, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeDBStatement. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeDBStatement) Copy http.method For external segments this is the http method of the outgoing request, called with newrelic.SpanAttributeHTTPMethod.

Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributeHTTPURL) Copy peer.address For datastore segments this is the hostname plus port of the database being queried, called with newrelic.SpanAttributePeerAddress. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributePeerAddress) Copy peer.hostname For datastore segments this is the hostname of the database being queried, called with newrelic.SpanAttributePeerHostname. Default settings: Transaction trace segments: Enabled Span events: Enabled Example of excluding this attribute: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.SpanAttributePeerHostname) Copy Change attribute destination Use these options to change attribute destinations: Turn destinations on or off To open or close an entire destination to attributes, set the .Enabled flag to true or false. For example, to turn off APM error collection: After the config, add: config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled = false Copy Turn attributes on or off To turn specific attributes on or off, use the .Include or .Exclude methods. For example, to disable AttributeResponseCode: After the config, add: config.Attributes.Exclude = append(config.Attributes.Exclude, newrelic.AttributeResponseCode) Copy Create custom attributes Add custom attributes by using this method in a transaction: txn.AddAttribute(\"key\", \"value\") Copy The txn variable is the one instrumented for the Go transaction. For example: txn.AddAttribute(\"product\", \"widget\") txn.AddAttribute(\"price\", 19.99) txn.AddAttribute(\"importantCustomer\", true) Copy Default settings for custom attribute destinations: Error collector (traced errors): Enabled Transaction events: Enabled For more help",

      "body": "With New Relic for Go, you can monitor the specific segments of a transaction in a Go application to get more detail about specific functions or code blocks. Measure time for functions and code blocks Segments are the specific parts of a transaction in an application. By instrumenting segments, you can measure the time taken by functions and code blocks, such as external calls, datastore calls, adding messages to queues, and background tasks. Example: You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You could instrument your application to break that transaction up into two pieces: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. Block-of-code segments Once you instrument a transaction, you are ready to instrument one or more segments in that transaction. To instrument an arbitrary block of code as a segment, use the following pattern, and include txn as the variable name set for the transaction: segment := newrelic.Segment{} segment.Name = \"mySegmentName\" segment.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... code you want to time here ... segment.End() Copy StartSegment is a convenient helper. It creates a segment and starts it: segment := txn.StartSegment(\"mySegmentName\") // ... code you want to time here ... segment.End() Copy Function segments Instrumenting a function as a segment is essentially the same as instrumenting an arbitrary block of code as a segment. The main difference is that, because a function has a discrete ending, you can use Go's defer statement. To instrument a function as a segment, add the following code at the start of the function, and include txn as the variable name set for the transaction: defer txn.StartSegment(\"mySegmentName\").End() Copy Nest segments Segments can be nested. The segment being ended must be the most recently started segment. Here's an example of a segment starting and ending inside another segment: s1 := txn.StartSegment(\"outerSegment\") s2 := txn.StartSegment(\"innerSegment\") // s2 must end before s1 s2.End() s1.End() Copy A zero value segment may safely be ended. Therefore, the following code is safe even if the conditional fails: var s newrelic.Segment if recordSegment { s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow(), } // ... code you wish to time here ... s.End() Copy Datastore segments You can instrument Go application datastore calls. Datastore segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown table and Databases tab of the Transactions page in New Relic. If you are using a MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite database driver, the easiest way to add Datastore segments is to use our pre-built integration packages. Otherwise, you can manually create Datastore segments for each database call. Use instrumentation package There is an integration package for each database driver that we support: Database library supported Integration package go-sql-driver/mysql v3/integrations/nrmysql lib/pq v3/integrations/nrpq mattn/go-sqlite3 v3/integrations/nrsqlite3 To use one of these integrations, first replace the driver with our integration version: import ( // import our integration package in place of \"github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql\" _ \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrmysql\" ) func main() { // open \"nrmysql\" in place of \"mysql\" db, err := sql.Open(\"nrmysql\", \"user@unix(/path/to/socket)/dbname\") } Copy Second, use the ExecContext, QueryContext, and QueryRowContext methods of sql.DB, sql.Conn, sql.Tx, and sql.Stmt and provide a transaction-containing context. Calls to Exec, Query, and QueryRow do not get instrumented. ctx := newrelic.NewContext(context.Background(), txn) row := db.QueryRowContext(ctx, \"SELECT count(*) from tables\") Copy If you are using a database/sql database not listed above, you can write your own instrumentation for it using InstrumentConnector, InstrumentDriver, and DriverSegmentBuilder. The integration packages act as examples of how to do this. Important Datastore integration packages for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite were added in Go Agent v2.8.0 and require Go v1.10 or above. Use DatastoreSegment Just like basic segments, datastore segments begin when the StartTime field is populated and finish when the End method is called. To instrument a datastore segment, place the following at the beginning of the function you want to monitor: s := newrelic.DatastoreSegment{ Product: newrelic.DatastoreMySQL, Collection: \"users\", Operation: \"INSERT\", ParameterizedQuery: \"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)\", QueryParameters: map[string]interface{}{ \"name\": \"Dracula\", \"age\": 439, }, Host: \"mysql-server-1\", PortPathOrID: \"3306\", DatabaseName: \"my_database\", } s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... make the datastore call s.End() Copy For more information about: Assigning the Collection, Operation, DatabaseName, and other parameter values: See the New Relic datastore segment documentation on GoDoc. Available values for Product: See the New Relic documentation on GitHub. When instrumenting a datastore call that spans an entire function call, you can use the defer statement to simplify instrumentation: s := newrelic.DatastoreSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), Product: newrelic.DatastoreMySQL, Collection: \"users\", Operation: \"INSERT\", ParameterizedQuery: \"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)\", QueryParameters: map[string]interface{}{ \"name\": \"Dracula\", \"age\": 439, }, Host: \"mysql-server-1\", PortPathOrID: \"3306\", DatabaseName: \"my_database\", } defer s.End() Copy External segments You can instrument Go application calls to external services, such as web services, resources in the cloud, and any other network calls. External segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown table and the External services page in New Relic. There are two ways to instrument external segments: Use StartExternalSegment() Recommendation: Use the StartExternalSegment helper, since New Relic uses it to trace activity between your applications using cross application tracing. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy Use NewRoundTripper() NewRoundTripper returns an http.RoundTripper, which allows you to instrument external calls without calling StartExternalSegment by modifying your http.Client's Transport field. The RoundTripper returned will look for a Transaction in the request's context using FromContext. Here is an example of NewRoundTripper instrumentation: client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://example.com\", nil) request = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(request, txn) response, err := client.Do(request) Copy Message producer segments You can instrument Go application calls that add messages to queuing systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka. Message producer segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown in New Relic. There is only one way to instrument message producer segments: Use MessageProducerSegment Just like basic segments, message producer segments begin when the StartTime field is populated, and finish when the End method is called. To instrument a message producer segment, place the following at the beginning of the function you want to monitor: s := newrelic.MessageProducerSegment{ Library: \"RabbitMQ\", DestinationType: newrelic.MessageExchange, DestinationName: \"myExchange\", DestinationTemporary: false, } s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... add message to queue s.End() Copy For more information about assigning the Library, DestinationType, DestinationName, or DestinationTemporary fields, see the New Relic message producer segment documentation on GoDoc. When instrumenting a message producer call that spans an entire function call, you can use the defer statement to simplify instrumentation: s := newrelic.MessageProducerSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), Library: \"RabbitMQ\", DestinationType: newrelic.MessageExchange, DestinationName: \"myExchange\", DestinationTemporary: false, } defer s.End() // ... add message to queue Copy Important Message producer segments were added in Go Agent version 2.14.0.",

When instrumenting a datastore call that spans an entire function call, you can use the defer statement to simplify instrumentation: s := newrelic.DatastoreSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), Product: newrelic.DatastoreMySQL, Collection: \"users\", Operation: \"INSERT\", ParameterizedQuery: \"INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ($1, $2)\", QueryParameters: map[string]interface{}{ \"name\": \"Dracula\", \"age\": 439, }, Host: \"mysql-server-1\", PortPathOrID: \"3306\", DatabaseName: \"my_database\", } defer s.End() Copy External segments You can instrument Go application calls to external services, such as web services, resources in the cloud, and any other network calls. External segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown table and the External services page in New Relic. There are two ways to instrument external segments: Use StartExternalSegment() Recommendation: Use the StartExternalSegment helper, since New Relic uses it to trace activity between your applications using cross application tracing. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy Use NewRoundTripper() NewRoundTripper returns an http.RoundTripper, which allows you to instrument external calls without calling StartExternalSegment by modifying your http.Client's Transport field. The RoundTripper returned will look for a Transaction in the request's context using FromContext. Here is an example of NewRoundTripper instrumentation: client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://example.com\", nil) request = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(request, txn) response, err := client.Do(request) Copy Message producer segments You can instrument Go application calls that add messages to queuing systems like RabbitMQ and Kafka. Message producer segments appear in the APM Transactions breakdown in New Relic. There is only one way to instrument message producer segments: Use MessageProducerSegment Just like basic segments, message producer segments begin when the StartTime field is populated, and finish when the End method is called. To instrument a message producer segment, place the following at the beginning of the function you want to monitor: s := newrelic.MessageProducerSegment{ Library: \"RabbitMQ\", DestinationType: newrelic.MessageExchange, DestinationName: \"myExchange\", DestinationTemporary: false, } s.StartTime = txn.StartSegmentNow() // ... add message to queue s.End() Copy For more information about assigning the Library, DestinationType, DestinationName, or DestinationTemporary fields, see the New Relic message producer segment documentation on GoDoc. When instrumenting a message producer call that spans an entire function call, you can use the defer statement to simplify instrumentation: s := newrelic.MessageProducerSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), Library: \"RabbitMQ\", DestinationType: newrelic.MessageExchange, DestinationName: \"myExchange\", DestinationTemporary: false, } defer s.End() // ... add message to queue Copy Important Message producer segments were added in Go Agent version 2.14.0.",
