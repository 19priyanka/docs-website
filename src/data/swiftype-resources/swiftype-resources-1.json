      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing model. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing models: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing model. Our original pricing model was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing model, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing model works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing models Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number. To edit billing settings, use the Billing UI. Adjustments to billing settings will take effect for the next billing period. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the New Relic APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing model. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription, go to the billing UI. View or change current subscription To adjust your subscription settings, use the Billing UI. If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your usage, use the usage UI. View or update billing information To view or update your New Relic account's billing information, see the billing UI.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic.

This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application.

Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI.

Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI.

Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI.

Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done.

In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing model, not our New Relic One pricing model. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

Let Applied Intelligence, our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents. Proactive detection: Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. Get notifications: Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but they can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.",

It's free, forever! account dropdown In the upper right of the New Relic UI, the account dropdown gives you access to your account settings. If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, and the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "To get up and running with Auto-telemetry with Pixie, you start with our guided installation. The guided installation deploys Pixie with New Relic's Kubernetes integration on your cluster. You don't need to do any further configuration or installation to start using Pixie. If you want to install Auto-telemetry with Pixie on multiple clusters, re-run the guided install for each additional cluster. General prerequisites for using Pixie Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever! You must be a New Relic full platform user. Other user-related requirements: Users on our New Relic One user model must be assigned to a group that has a role with Pixie-related capabilities. Users on our original user model cannot be Restricted. In addition: Review this Pixie data security overview for actions to take to secure your data. Make sure you have sufficient memory. Pixie requires at least 2Gb of memory on each node in your cluster. More memory may be required for larger clusters. Pixie needs to run in privileged mode. Review the other Pixie technical requirements. Setup steps depend on your account status Use the following table to find out where to start installing Auto-telemetry with Pixie. Where you start the installation depends on whether you already have a New Relic or Pixie account, or both. New Relic Pixie Next steps Start the guided install at the beginning of the process. If you already have both types of accounts, and used the same email address for each of them, click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI. This brings you to the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file section of the guided installation. Then, follow the steps. If you're using different email addresses in Pixie and New Relic, create a new account for either Pixie or New Relic to match email addresses across both products. You can also contact New Relic support to manually link your existing New Relic account with your Pixie account. If you follow a link to New Relic from the Pixie UI and do not have a New Relic account, you must first create one. Click the New Relic icon in the Pixie UI, and follow the steps to create a New Relic account. When you do so, your Pixie account is linked to it. Then, continue the guided install process with these steps. Sign up for a free New Relic account. Then, start the guided install at the beginning of the process. Install from the beginning of the guided install process Open our New Relic One guided install. Select the account you want to use for the guided install, and click Continue. Note: if you have a single account, you won't see this option. Select Kubernetes and then continue with step one in the next section. Install from the Configure the HELM command/manifest (yaml) file If you arrived in the guided installation process by following a link from Pixie or from within New Relic, your steps begin here. Select the account and cluster for the install. If needed, select a namespace. Important Currently, Pixie performs best on clusters with up to 100 nodes (exceeding 100 nodes can lead to excessive memory usage and scripts failing to run). Friendly reminder: autoscaling can quickly drive up your node numbers. Click Continue. Select the data you want to gather, observe, and debug, and click Continue. On the Choose install method page, select either Helm or manifest. Helm method Run the provided Helm command on your command line. If you're concerned about the amount of Pixie data you'll ingest, check out strategies for reducing ingest. Helm installs a bundle containing the New Relic infrastructure agent, an integration to gather Prometheus metrics and Kubernetes events, and the Pixie integration. The deployment takes a few minutes to complete. To see the status of the install to the cluster, run kubectl get pods -n newrelic. For general information about installing a Kubernetes integration, see this Helm install info. manifest method Run the provided command in your console, and insert the path to your downloaded manifest. If you're running your Kubernetes cluster in the cloud, see the additional steps in the Kubernetes docs. Click Continue to open the Listening for data page. When you get the message, See your data, click Kubernetes Cluster Explorer to see your cluster. Auto-telemetry with Pixie might restart after installation. This is caused by the auto update feature. If you link the wrong Pixie and New Relic account Contact support to unlink a Pixie account from your New Relic account. Be aware that if you unlink a Pixie account that was created automatically through the guided install, you'll lose access to that Pixie account.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI.

      "body": "Depending on your user model, you have different options for adding and managing accounts and assigning users to them. We have two models: New Relic One user model Original user model Important Note that the user model is not directly related to our two pricing models. New Relic One user model Important This section is about organizations on the New Relic One user model, not the original model. Learn more about the difference. At New Relic, an \"organization\" represents a New Relic customer. The organization contains everything relevant to a New Relic customer: its accounts, its users, and its data. A New Relic \"account\" can be considered a workspace. For example, you might have an account for a specific app, or a set of related hosts and services for a specific initiative or project, or you might have an account for a specific team. Each account has its own account ID, and that ID is used for some account-specific tasks, like making API calls. Our Standard edition allows for a single account per organization. Pro and Enterprise editions allow for multiple accounts per organization. Currently you can't add accounts to your organization on your own. To add accounts, talk to your New Relic account representative. How users access accounts In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users’ access to accounts, you create access grants, which assign a group of users to a specific role on a specific account. For example, you may assign a user group the ability to manage billing on some accounts with the Billing manager role, and assign some users as non-admin full platform users on some accounts, and assign some users as basic users on some accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that’s a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. Learn more about user management. Note that some features, like dashboards and workloads, can display data from across different accounts in an organization. This means that if a user isn’t granted access to all relevant accounts, they may experience missing data. To learn more about access issues, see Factors affecting access.

      "body": "There are several factors that can affect your access to a New Relic feature, or New Relic data. User permissions User-related settings can impact what features or data you have access to. Potential impacts include: Your user type (basic user or full platform user). Your assigned roles. How your user roles and permissions work depends on which user model you're on: Original user model roles New Relic One user model roles If you think your permissions are preventing you from accessing something, talk to your New Relic administrators. Account access If you're having trouble finding an account, here are some causes and solutions: If your organization has multiple accounts and you have access to those accounts, you will see an account switcher at the top left of most New Relic UI pages that will let you switch between accounts. If you're logged into New Relic but can't find an account or its data, it may be for one of these reasons: You may need to be added to that account. How you do this will depend on your user model: Original use model | New Relic One user model. You may have more than one New Relic login associated with the same email address. If you think this may be the case, log out and log back in. When you input your email address, the login UI notes if you have multiple user records and gives you an option for verifying your email to see all available accounts when you log in. Other details about multiple logins: To see all your available login options the next time you log in, select Remember me when logging in. If one of your login options reads \"Original account\", that means it's a user record on our original user model. For more information, see this Explorers Hub post about multiple accounts. Related docs: User permission factors Account structure Login and password troubleshooting Delete accounts Pricing plan or edition We have two pricing models available, and this can impact feature availability. Pricing plans: Our original product-based pricing model: This plan separates our offerings by product. If you’re on this plan, access to some features may depend on the products you pay for. Our New Relic One pricing model: This newer pricing model gives more cross-platform access. The main factors affecting access are your edition and your user type. We also have several pricing editions: Standard, Pro, and Enterprise. Learn more about our pricing models. The entities being monitored Some of our solutions enable functionality that isn’t available to all users, like: Additional UI components, and Data available for querying For example, enabling distributed tracing results in you seeing trace data in the UI and in having trace data available for querying. If you are missing data that you expect to see, see Missing data. Data retention Different types of New Relic data have different data retention periods.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full platform) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic and full platform) Note that there are limits around how many times full platform users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full platform users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "New Relic is an observability platform that helps you build better software. You can bring in data from any digital source so that you can fully understand your system and how to improve it. This short video shows twenty of the most common ways to get your data into New Relic (approx. 5:22 minutes): With New Relic, you can: Bring all your data together: Instrument everything and import data from across your technology stack using our agents, integrations, and APIs, and access it from a single UI. Analyze your data: Get all your data at your fingertips to find the root causes of problems and optimize your systems. Build dashboards and charts or use our powerful query language. Respond to incidents quickly: Our machine learning solution proactively detects and explains anomalies and warns you before they become problems. Get started with New Relic Here's how you can quickly get started capturing and analyzing your data: If you don't have a New Relic account, sign up at newrelic.com/signup. It's free, forever! Follow the steps in our Add your data UI page to get data flowing in. For your first install, we recommend the Guided install option, which will set up many integrations with a single command. Once you have data coming into New Relic, learn more about the New Relic UI or set up Alerts. All the answers in one place New Relic is built for full stack observability. It links all relevant data so that you get the whole picture of everything that enables your systems to deliver value to your customers, from the container running a microservice in the cloud to a mobile website's shopping cart button. Monitoring vs. observability: New Relic provides answers to essential questions in one place. As just one example of what you can do with New Relic, imagine you are a Kubernetes administrator overseeing many clusters and pods of software containers. Where do you start troubleshooting? This short video shows how you can locate a problem cluster and use distributed tracing to find relevant logs: Bring all your data together Capture, organize, and make sense of your data in New Relic One, no matter where it comes from. Use our agents and integrations to automatically collect data from common frameworks and tools, or use our APIs for data that’s more specific to your business or technology. If you don't see your technologies or tasks listed here, see a larger list at New Relic Instant Observability. There you will find integrations bundled into quickstarts, providing you instant access to pre-built dashboards and alerts specific to your technology. If you want to... New Relic can help you... Instrument your application Instrument your code: Use our APM agents to automatically instrument your applications in C, Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Track transactions: Gather distributed tracing details as your transactions cross boundaries between apps and services. Instrument your environment Instrument your infrastructure: Observe your entire environment (including Linux, Windows, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Kubernetes, Docker, and more). Collect and centralize logs: See your log data in context with your other application and infrastructure data. Save time switching between tools and reach solutions more quickly. Instrument your digital experiences Enhance browser performance: Decrease page load times, as well as triage and eliminate errors. Monitor mobile apps: Troubleshoot crashes and check the health of your Android and iOS apps with our mobile agents. Simulate user activity: Ensure you’re meeting customer expectations by running automated checks to monitor key user flows and experiences. Send data via APIs or build your own solution Collect data without an agent: Call our APIs directly if you prefer to use OpenTelemetry or other agents. Build your own integration: You can use our Flex tool, or one of language-specific SDKs for creating your own exporters to send data to New Relic. New Relic One gives you access to a wide range of observability tools, including: Application monitoring Browser monitoring Mobile monitoring Synthetic monitoring Serverless monitoring Infrastructure monitoring Log management You can start anywhere, but you'll never get lost. True observability across your entire stack means that you're in control. Analyze your data With your data secure at New Relic, our platform can alert you to problems and help you organize, process, and understand your data, whether it's metrics, events, logs, or traces: Explore your data visually: Jump into our data explorer to navigate all your data and make connections between your entities without any knowledge of query languages. Query and visualize your data: Use our curated dashboard visualizations or create your own. Use NRQL (New Relic Query Language) to slice and dice your data and dig deeper into questions. Query your data programmatically: Access your data through our NerdGraph GraphQL API. Easily prototype queries in our GraphiQL editor. Respond to incidents faster DevOps, site-reliability, and network operation teams need reliable, real-time alerts and anomaly detection to ensure their systems are always up and running efficiently. Let Applied Intelligence, our hybrid machine learning engine, automatically detect anomalies, reduce alert noise, and enrich incidents with context so that you can respond faster to incidents. Proactive detection: Be notified of unusual app behavior and get an analysis of this unusual behavior sent to Slack. Not using Slack? Set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. Get notifications: Set up alerts across your data sources and get notified when systems need your attention. Preserve your attention and control how many threshold violations should fire before you're notified. Troubleshoot from anywhere in your stack Being fully connected, the New Relic UI allows you to start your observability journey from any element of your stack. For example, you can get to crucial infrastructure logs from traces of an application running on a problematic Kubernetes pod. Use the Explorer in New Relic One to access and observe the full stack of your software, see performance data and alerting status at a glance, and check relationships. We provide you with a simple yet powerful visual tool to monitor all your entities, that is, anything we can identify that reports data. In the New Relic ecosystem, entities include basic components like applications, hosts, containers, or database services, but they can also refer to custom groupings of such elements. You can also create your own entities. The more entities you instrument, the more data you'll bring in. The more data you've brought to New Relic, the more you'll understand your metrics, events, logs, and traces.",

If you're trying to switch between accounts, use the account switcher. account switcher If you have access to more than one account in a multi-account organization, you can use the account switcher to switch between accounts. This is located in the top right of most New Relic UI pages. For more on factors that affect access to accounts, see Factors affecting access. To find account settings, use the account dropdown. administrator A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. agent At New Relic, an agent is a piece of monitoring software that provides integrations with various technologies (for example, web frameworks, host operating systems, or database types). The agents send that data to New Relic, usually on a specific cadence. For more information, see: New Relic Instant Observability Install agents agent API Some New Relic agents have agent APIs that allow you to extend the functionality of an agent. You can use the API to control, customize and extend the functionality of the agent. Here are some agent API docs: APM agents: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Ruby agent API Python agent API Browser agent: Browser agent API Mobile agents: iOS SDK API Android SDK API aggregated metrics Aggregated metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application, including how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on the New Relic tool and your subscription level. For more information, see the documentation about data retention. aggregation delay The length of time in seconds to wait for the aggregation window to fill with data. Required when using CADENCE or EVENT_FLOW aggreation_method types. aggregation function You can use NRQL query functions, such as sum(), average(), or latest() to choose how the data points in an aggregation window should be processed into a single data point. The single aggregated data point is what's passed through the alert evaluation process. aggregation method New Relic aggregates data into windows, and needs to determine when the current window ends and the next one begins. The aggregation_method is the logic that tells us when we have all the data for a given aggregation window. Once the window is closed, the data is aggregated into a single point and evaluated against the threshold. This field is optional. One of the following three values can be specified: EVENT_FLOW: (Default) Each aggregation window will wait until it starts to see timestamps arrive that are past its own delay setting. Once this occurs, the data is published. Relies on the timestamps of arriving data, so wall-clock time is no longer relevant. Works best for sources that come in frequently and with low event spread (high througput metrics) CADENCE: Classic New Relic logic where each evaluation window waits exactly as long as the aggregation_delay setting, using the wall-clock time as a timer. aggregation_delay is required when using this option. Data arriving too late will be dropped, which can cause false alerts. EVENT_TIMER: Each aggregation window has a timer on it, set to the aggregation_timer setting. The Timer starts running as soon as the first data point appears for that aggregation window (based on the data point’s timestamp). The aggregation_timer is reset for each new data point that arrives for that window. Once the aggregation_timer reaches 0, the aggregation window is published. Ideal for sparse and batched data, such as cloud integrations and infrequent error logs. aggregation timer The length of time in seconds to wait after each data point received, to ensure the entire batch is processed. Required when using EVENT_TIMER aggregation_method type. aggregation window Streaming alerts gathers data together into specific amounts of time. These windows of time are customizable. Data points are collected together based their timestamps and reported as a batch. The customizable aggregation window provides greater flexibility and fewer false violations when alerting on irregular or less frequent data points. alert An alert communicates an event or incident that designated personnel can track through Alerts. For an explanation of how basic alerts concepts are related, see Concepts and workflow. alert condition An alert condition (or condition), identified by its unique numeric condition_id, contains the criteria for creating a violation. The condition includes the threshold that is set for a metric timeslice or a custom metric over time on a chosen target. For an explanation of how a condition relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. alert evaluation Streaming data is assessed on a set of aggregation windows to determine if an alert condition is violating or recovering. The aggregation window time is how long we'll collect data before running the NRQL query condition. The offset evaluation time is how long you want us to wait for late data before assessing it. If a window doesn't have any data points, it's treated as a gap for loss of signal. alert policy A collection of one or more conditions, one or more notification channels, and an Incident preference setting. If a condition contained within the policy opens a violation, an incident may be opened depending on the Incident preference setting. Notifications will then be sent to all channels attached to the policy. For an explanation of how a policy relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. apdex Apdex is an industry-standard way to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of an application or service. New Relic rates each response as Satisfied, Tolerated, or Frustrated, and uses these ratings to calculate an overall user satisfaction score. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_f The response time above which a transaction are rated frustrating. Defaults to four times apdex_t. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take longer than apdex_t, but less than four times apdex_t (apdex_f), are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. apdex_t The response time above which a transaction is considered tolerable. The default value is 0.5 seconds, but you can change this in your Apdex settings. Requests that complete in less than apdex_t are rated satisfied. Requests that take more than apdex_t, but less than apdex_f, are tolerated. Any requests that take longer than apdex_f are rated frustrating. For more information, see Apdex: Measure user satisfaction. API (application programming interface) New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs. For more information, see the introduction to New Relic's APIs. APM New Relic's APM (application performance monitoring) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. application For New Relic purposes, any program instrumented by New Relic. application ID Some New Relic solutions assign a monitored application a unique application ID, often shortened to app ID. When present, this ID is available in the UI. It is also reported as an attribute and can be queried. For how to determine this, see Find app ID. application name The name that New Relic combines with your license key to uniquely identify a particular app. For more information, see Name your application. Applied Intelligence (AI) Applied Intelligence (AI) helps you find, troubleshoot, and resolve problems more quickly. Specifically, it’s a hybrid machine learning engine that reduces alert noise, correlates incidents, and automatically detects anomalies. Applied Intelligence includes Alerts, Incident Intelligence, and Proactive Detection. attribute Attributes are key-value pairs attached to data objects reported to New Relic. Attributes add detail, and they're similar to tags or labels in other SaaS software. You can explore this data by querying or searching via the UI or by using the data dictionary. Examples: APM reports a Transaction event. This includes timing data for the transaction in a duration attribute, which might have a value of .002. Our Infrastructure Monitoring reports a ProcessSample event. This includes a variety of CPU usage attributes, including a cpuSystemPercent attribute, which might have a value of .01. Our Telemetry SDK reports a Metric data type for storing metrics, with attached attributes like metricName and newrelic.source. Some New Relic tools allow you to report custom attributes to enhance your monitoring. For more information about attributes in APM, see Agent attributes. availability monitoring See Types of Synthetics monitors. browser The New Relic UI supports most browsers. For more information, see Supported browsers. For our end-user browser monitoring tool, see Browser Monitoring. Browser monitoring A Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution that measures the speed and performance of your end users as they navigate to your site from different web browsers, devices, operating systems, and networks. background external See web external. child account See parent account. cloud-based integration New Relic offers cloud-based integrations with providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. collector The component that collects data from New Relic agents running on an app server, mobile device, or end-user browser. While the agent is installed on a user's app server, the collectors are centrally located in New Relic's data center. In order to contact the collector, the agent must be able to reach New Relic's domains and IP addresses. (The exact domain or IP depends on the New Relic monitoring tool.) The collector receives and interprets this data, and stores it in a database. The data is then retrieved and presented in the New Relic UI and by our various REST APIs. Command line interface (CLI) Our command line interface (CLI) is a tool you can use to build a New Relic application. This is the same tool our own engineers use. Go here for quick start instructions. Go to our Developer site for sample apps and guides. compute unit (CU) A unit of measurement that determines your pricing for some New Relic products governed by our original product-based pricing model. For more information, see Compute unit pricing. condition_id See alert condition. CPM (calls per minute) The number of calls your application receives each minute. This usually corresponds to the number of page views or external connections, and is usually the same as RPM (requests per minute). CPU burn The time consumed by code minus the wait time for a transaction. This is the time actually spent processing the transaction. It appears in the New Relic UI at the top of the transaction view for the agents that provide it (Ruby and PHP only). custom attribute A key-value pair added to a transaction or event in order to gain additional information about it. For more information, see custom attributes. custom dashboard A customizable dashboard with charts and tables that includes data from multiple New Relic data sources. For more information, see dashboards. custom event An event, in New Relic terms, is a data object with attached attributes. New Relic reports default event types, like Transaction and TransactionError. You can also create your own events. Events can be queried, and are used in some other features. You can generate custom events with APM agents, the browser monitoring agent, the mobile monitoring agents, and via the Event API. Alternatively, you can add custom attributes to some existing default New Relic events. custom instrumentation Custom instrumentation allows you to extend New Relic's monitoring to instrument code elements New Relic doesn't automatically instrument. Custom instrumentation is useful when your framework is not supported by New Relic, or when New Relic fails to pick up some element of your program. You can also use custom instrumentation to block a transaction from being reported entirely. For more information, see Custom instrumentation. custom metric Metric timeslice data that is manually recorded via an API call. Custom metrics allow you to record arbitrary metrics; for example, timing or computer resource data. All custom metric names must be prefixed with Custom/. For more information, see Custom metrics. Not to be confused with custom instrumentation data. data collector See collector. data explorer Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience. For more on using the data explorer, see Introduction to the data explorer. degradation period When a data source enters a violating state, a degradation period of time begins. The degradation period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will open if the source stays in a violating state for the entire degradation period. In addition: If the data source enters a non-violating state before the entire time has elapsed, the degradation period countdown is reset, and a violation does not open. If your alert condition threshold is configured as at least once in, the degradation period always lasts a single minute. dimensional metric A dimensional metric is a metric that has multiple attributes, also known as dimensions. At New Relic, we report dimensional metrics using the Metric data type. For more on other metric data types, see Metric data. Docker An open platform for distributed applications, which allows you to assemble multi-container portable apps. Infrastructure Monitoring includes integrated Docker monitoring. For more information about Docker, see the Docker website. downtime The period of time when customers cannot access your site and your app is not reporting to New Relic. For more information, see Synthetic Monitoring and Types of synthetic monitors. entity In New Relic, an entity is anything we can identify that has data you can monitor. An entity can be something you monitor directly, like applications and microservices, or indirectly, like data centers. You can identify one or more entities to be targets for alert conditions. In the Alerts API, the entity being monitored is identified with an entity_id. For more on this, see What are entities? event The word event is a general term that can have many meanings. At New Relic, event can have several meanings: At New Relic, event data is one of our core data types. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. Events can vary by type (for example, Transaction or Mobile, and will have associated attributes (for example, timestamp or transactionName). For more details, see Event data. For our infrastructure monitoring, the word event can be used to refer to important system and host activity. For example, a configuration change for a monitored host would be registered on Infrastructure's Events UI page. For alerts, the Events UI page displays a list of alerts-related incidents for your monitored entities. Events are reported for a violation opening and for closing. In some contexts, event can refer to any NRQL-queryable data type. For example, when you run a NRQL query, you will see a count of inspected events: this refers to a count of all data types queried. expected error An expected error is a common error that you don't want to affect your Apdex score or error rate. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. exporter At New Relic, an exporter is a type of integration that reports telemetry data to New Relic from a third-party (non-New Relic) telemetry tool. For examples, see Exporters, or search our integration quickstarts in New Relic I/O. Flex New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one infrastructure integration. With it, you can build your own integration that collects metric data from a wide variety of services, and that can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text) to the terminal. It's a recommended way to create a custom integration, because it doesn't require coding skills. framework A framework is a structured collection of pre-defined functions, into which an application builder inserts their own code to build their application. A framework is not the same as a library. While a library is a collection of functions you can call as needed, a framework is a skeleton for your application. The functions in that framework then call your functions. For more about the distinction between a framework and a library, see What is the difference between a framework and a library?. New Relic automatically instruments many common frameworks. For more about the frameworks New Relic supports, see the agent-specific documentation: C SDK supported frameworks Go supported frameworks Java supported frameworks .NET supported frameworks Node.js supported frameworks PHP supported frameworks Python supported frameworks Ruby supported frameworks harvest cycle The period of time between each connection from a New Relic agent to the collector. Between harvest cycles, an agent collects and caches data. At the end of the cycle an agent reports those data to the collector, then begins a new harvest cycle. health status indicator Some New Relic UI pages have a health status indicator appearing next to an index of monitored entities. This is a colored bar (generally green, yellow, red, or gray) indicating the status of your app or other entity monitored by New Relic. It also indicates whether the entity has any alert policies assigned to it and whether there are any policy violations. In general, the colored bar will be green, yellow, red, or gray to indicate the health status. Exceptions: Our REST API (v2) uses orange instead of yellow for the application's health and reporting status. Service maps use different criteria for reporting the health of a connection between an app and an external service not monitored by New Relic (for example, a third party API). host At New Relic, a host means one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. host ID Each host identified by APM is assigned a host ID. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that host via the REST API. For more information, see List host ID. ignored error An error that you have told the APM agent not to report to the collector. For more information, see Manage errors in APM. incident An incident is a collection of one or more violations of the conditions defined in an alert policy. An incident record includes all of the open and close time stamps for each violation, as well as chart snapshots of the data being evaluated around the time of each violation. You can view detailed information from the Incidents pages in the user interface. You can also select your preference for how we roll up violations into the incident. For an explanation of how an incident relates to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. Infrastructure monitoring By connecting changes in host performance to changes in your configuration, infrastructure monitoring provides real-time metrics and powerful analytics that reduce your mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR). Infrastructure is specifically designed for complex environments that need flexible, dynamic server monitoring, from a physical datacenter to thousands of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and other types of integrations. Insights Insights was the name for the New Relic product that previously governed the reporting of custom events, and the ability to query and chart your New Relic data. These features are now a fundamental part of the New Relic One platform and are no longer governed by the Insights product or name. To learn more about these features: Event API for reporting custom events Query and chart data For historical reasons, the word \"Insights\" is still used in some places. For example: For New Relic organizations on our original pricing model, Insights Pro is still the product name governing custom event data ingest and retention. Some APM agents still have Insights language in their codebase. For example, the Java agent custom_insights_events configuration. There is an API key called the Insights insert key. instance ID Each instance identified by New Relic is assigned a unique instance ID. Instance IDs are most commonly found for JVMs (Java Virtual Machines), but can exist for each agent. This ID is used to uniquely identify it, and to retrieve data about that instance via the REST API. For more information, see List instance IDs. instrumentation The collection of data from an application or host. When New Relic instruments a framework, it detects the methods and calls used by that framework, and intelligently groups them together. integration At New Relic, an integration refers to a solution that integrates with a specific technology (like a web framework or a type of database). All our integrations can be found as quickstarts in New Relic Instant Observability. interaction In our mobile monitoring, an interaction is a specific code path initiated by a user interaction (usually a button press). An interaction is the mobile equivalent of a transaction, and like a transaction an interaction can be traced and monitored. You can see much of the data included in an interaction in the BrowserInteraction event. interaction trace An interaction trace is a complete picture of a single interaction. With interaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow interaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. Interaction traces are the mobile equivalent of a transaction trace. For more information, see Creating interactions (iOS) and Creating interactions (Android). inventory data Inventory data is information about the status or configuration of a service or host. Examples of inventory data include: Configuration settings Name of the host the service is on Amazon AWS region Port being used For more information, see Understand and use data. key transaction A web transaction that the user has marked as particularly important; for example, key business events (such as signups or purchase confirmations), or transactions with a high performance impact (such as searches). Key transactions have their own pages in the UI and other customized values. For more information, see Key transactions. launcher A launcher is a specific piece of code you can include when you create a New Relic One app. It creates the tile on the homepage that you click to launch the app. For more information, see the documentation about core UI components. log A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. For more information on how we use log data, see Log management. Log monitoring Our log management and monitoring features give you the tools to collect, process, explore, visualize, and alert on your log data using your existing log forwarder. With all of your log data in one place, you'll be able to make better decisions, detect and resolve problems more quickly, and see your logs in context to troubleshoot faster. Logs Our Logs feature is a scalable log management platform that allows you to connect your log data with the rest of your telemetry data. Pre-built plugins with some of the most common open-source logging tools make it simple to send your data from anywhere to New Relic. Logs in context Logs in context makes it easy to link to your log data with related data across the rest of our platform. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool allows you to quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. master account See parent account. metric A metric is a numeric measurement. Metric data is a broad category because there are several ways to make and report measurements. For more about how metrics are reported at New Relic, see New Relic data types. metric timeslice New Relic reports metrics in several ways. One variety of metric data is called metric timeslice data; this is the type of data used to generate many of the charts in APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring (for more details, see metric timeslice data). Over time, metric timeslice data is aggregated into longer timeslice data records for more efficient storage. For more about how we aggregate this type of data, see Data aggregation. For how to query this type of data, see Query metric timeslice data. metric grouping issue A metric grouping issue occurs when an account sends too many differently named metric timeslice data points to New Relic, and those individual web transactions are not properly aggregated. For example, rather than a single /user/controlpanel/ metric name, you might see /user/controlpanel/alice, /user/controlpanel/bob, and /user/controlpanel/carol. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. minion The software that accepts monitor jobs from a private location. A minion is a packaged virtual appliance that runs in your hypervisor. For more information, see Private locations overview and install and configure private minions. Mobile monitoring Mobile monitoring allows you to monitor and manage the performance of your mobile apps on Android, iOS, tvOS, and other systems. Mobile monitoring provides end-to-end details, including crashes, throughput, HTTP requests, error traces, and more. Not to be confused with New Relic's own mobile apps for Android, iPhone, and iPad. monitor For our Synthetic Monitoring, a monitor ensures your website or API endpoint is available. For more information, see Adding and editing monitors. NerdGraph NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time and enables powerful developer tools. You can use our NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to explore the schema and find definitions. With valid New Relic API key, you can try it out yourself at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Nerdlet A Nerdlet is a component of a New Relic One application. It's a specific UI view, represented by a React JavaScript package. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. Nerdpack A Nerdpack is a component of a New Relic One application. It's the package containing all the files needed by that application. For more information, see Nerdpack file structure. New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing New Relic Edge with Infinite Tracing is a fully managed, distributed tracing service that observes 100% of your application traces, then provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. For more information, see /docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works. New Relic One For more information, see Introduction to New Relic One. New Relic One catalog Our catalog is a collection of applications built on the New Relic One platform. The catalog includes custom apps we've built, public open source apps, and any apps that you buid. You can browse the catalog on New Relic One. NRQL (New Relic query language) NRQL is a query language, similar in form to SQL, that allows you to query the data stored in your New Relic account. non-web transaction APM identifies transactions as either web or non-web. When New Relic does not detect a transaction was initiated by a web request, this is called a non-web transaction. For more information, see Background processes and other non-web transactions. notification The message sent when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. The type of notification is defined by the alert policy's notification channel. For an explanation of how notifications relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. notification channel Where we send a notification when an incident opens, is acknowledged, or closes. Available channels include email, mobile push notifications, webhooks, and more. on-host integration On-host integrations refer to integrations that reside on your own servers or hosts and that communicate with our infrastructure agent. For more information, see Introduction to on-host integrations. owner For accounts on our original pricing model, this is a type of user role: the user who initially created the account. For more information, see Users. page load timing With page load timing, New Relic monitors the full load time for end-user browsers. New Relic's application agents dynamically inject JavaScript into the page, then capture the following key load points: Navigation start: The user initiates the transaction. First byte: The browser receives the requested page. DOM ready: The browser has finished parsing DOM. Page ready: Page loading is complete. Page load timing is sometimes referred to as RUM, or real user monitoring. Unlike standard RUM, page load timing also captures JavaScript errors and AJAX requests. For more information, see Page load timing process. parameter Deprecated term; see attribute. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This structure was much more important for organizations on our original user model, but is still used for some features for organizations on the New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as \"master accounts\", and child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". permalink A unique URL that links to a view of your application at a specific point in time. Permalinks are useful for troubleshooting and for sharing interesting time windows with colleagues. pinger The component of New Relic that connects to your website to verify your website is accessible. New Relic has pingers in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Each pinger attempts to contact your website at least once every two minutes. If enough pingers are unable to reach your website, your application will be considered down. For in-depth scriptable testing, including real browser tests and tests of API endpoints, see Synthetic Monitoring. Synthetic Monitoring includes free ping monitoring, which allows you to monitor your website from locations around the world. For more information, see Types of Synthetic monitors. polling interval (AWS) Our Amazon integrations query your AWS services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. Each polling interval occurs for every AWS entity. For example, if you have thirteen Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), each one will be polled every five minutes. Depending on the AWS integration, there may be delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. If you notice unusual delays, follow the integration troubleshooting procedures. PPM (pages per minute) The number of pages per minute your application serves. private location A Synthetic monitor feature that allows you to run Synthetic monitors from within your own systems by creating private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your Synthetic coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall such as an intranet site. For more information, see Private locations overview. recovery period A recovery period of time begins when a data source enters a non-violating state after being in a violating state. The recovery period is set in the condition's threshold. A violation will close when a source remains in a non-violating state and the recovery period time has elapsed. If the data source enters a violating state before the time has elapsed, the recovery period clock will reset and the violation won't close. response time The duration of time between a request for service and a response. For more information, see Response time. restricted user A type of user role on a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. rollup Using the same application name for multiple applications. This allows you to combine data in APM, either from multiple applications, or from multiple instances of an application. For more information, see Rolling up app data. root span For distributed tracing, the root span is the first span in a trace. In many cases, the root span duration will represent the duration of the entire trace, or be very close to it. However, for more complex, modern systems that use a lot of asynchronous, non-blocking processes, this will not be true. For those systems, the root span’s duration may be significantly less than the duration of the trace. RPM The term RPM usually refers to the number of requests per minute your application receives from users. This is usually the same as CPM (calls per minute). Historically, some New Relic monitoring solutions, like APM and Browser Monitoring, used to contain RPM in the URL; for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com. This language use originally referred to Rails performance management because the first iteration of our product monitored Ruby on Rails applications. We monitor many more languages and systems than Ruby now. RUM (real user monitoring) See page load timing. runbook A runbook contains standard procedures and operations typically used by system administrators, network operations staff, and other personnel to handle outages, alert incidents, and other situations. If your organization stores runbook instructions as URLs, you can link this information to an alerts policy so your personnel has easy access to this information when an incident violates the defined policy thresholds. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) SAML is an XML-based data format for sharing authentication data between two parties. New Relic accounts must obtain a SAML certificate in order to enable Single Sign On for their users. For more information, see SAML service providers. Selenium Selenium is an open-source browser testing suite. Synthetics uses Selenium to test monitored websites with real browsers. For more information, see monitor types. service A service is a cluster of runtime server processes that accomplish a particular task, usually service requests. Unlike an application, a service is not usually invoked by a human. New Relic offers a variety of integrations that allow you to report data from your services. signal The stream of telemetry data that's watched and alerted on. You use NRQL queries to define a signal. signal filter When we receive data and it's routed to the streaming alerts platform, your NRQL WHERE clause will filter the data coming in. The filtered streaming data is what's evaluated for loss of signal violations, for example. span In a distributed trace, a span is a \"named, timed operation representing a contiguous segment of work in that trace\" (from OpenTracing.io definition). For distributed tracing, spans are displayed in the distributed tracing UI, and the data type Span is available to be queried. See also root span. SSL certificate SSL certificates encrypt data that is being transmitted. While New Relic refers to security certificates as SSL because it is a more commonly used term, all certificates adhere to industry standards for secure encryption in transit. SSO (single sign on) SSO (single sign on) allows you to manage user authentication in New Relic using an external SSO provider. For more information, see Setting up SSO. streaming algorithm This is what determines when the data in an aggregation window is processed. The streaming algorithm uses your server's clock time and the aggregation window size to trigger the alert evaluation process. sub-accounts See master account. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic monitoring allows you to monitor your website or API endpoint via automated, scriptable tools. Use free ping monitor to ensure your website is accessible, or expand your monitoring with browser monitors, which test your website with real browsers. Go further with scripting, to script browsers or API monitors for sophisticated testing. target A target is a resource or component monitored by a New Relic monitoring tool that has been identified in an alert condition. When the data source for that target crosses the defined critical threshold, we will open a violation. Depending on your policy's Incident preference setting, Alerts may create an incident record and send notifications through the defined channels. See also entity. tag Tags are key:value metadata added to monitored apps, hosts, dashboards, and other entities to help you organize your data at a high level. For details, see Tags. thresholds Thresholds are alert condition settings that define a violation. Threshold values include the value a data source must pass to trigger a violation and the time-related settings that define a violation; for example: Passing a certain value for at least x minutes Passing a certain value only once in x minutes While the data source passes a certain value, a degradation period starts. Likewise, when that data source stops passing a certain value, a recovery period starts. The durations of these two time periods are defined in the alert condition threshold settings. Thresholds have a required critical (red) threshold and an optional warning (yellow) threshold. In the UI, the entity's health status indicator will change to yellow or red when a threshold has been crossed and a violation will open. For more information, see Define thresholds. For an explanation of how thresholds relate to other basic Alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. throughput Throughput is a measurement of user activity for a monitored application. APM throughput and Browser Monitoring throughput are measured in different ways: APM: requests per minute (RPM) Browser: page views per minute (PPM) tier A tier can refer to how New Relic categorizes or visualizes the various agent language ecosystems that we support. For example: In APM, the color-coded categories that appear on your app's main Overview chart show response time spent in various functions, processes, or agents as tiers; for example, request queuing, garbage collection, Middleware, JVMs, etc. In New Relic labels, TIER can be used to define or classify the client-server architecture; for example, front-end and back-end tiers. \"Tier\" may sometimes be used to refer to our pricing editions. time picker By default the New Relic UI shows data for the past 30 minutes, ending now. To change the time window, use the time picker. time range A time range can refer to a length of time selected in the New Relic UI. New Relic displays a time range depending on the range you select using the time picker. timeslice data See metric timeslice data. trace A trace is a description of how a request travels through a system. Trace data helps you understand the performance of your system and diagnose problems. For more information on how we use trace data, see New Relic data types. traffic light See health status. transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. For more information, see documentation about web transactions and non-web transactions. The term transaction is also sometimes used in Browser Monitoring. In that case, it primarily refers to activity beginning with a browser-side web request and ending with a complete page load. transaction trace A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction, down to the database queries and exact invocation patterns. With transaction traces, New Relic gives you much deeper visibility into a single slow transaction, which can help you understand a broader problem. For more information, see Transaction traces. UI The New Relic user interface. For more information, see Standard page functions. user A user can refer to a specific user role in a New Relic account. For more information, see Users. UTC Universal Time Coordinated (UTC), or Coordinated Universal Time, is a standard timestamp for synchronizing time around the world. value function (metrics) The numeric value obtained from metric timeslice data; for example, an average, minimum, maximum, total, sample size, etc. violation A violation occurs when the entity monitored by an alert condition reports a value that crosses the thresholds defined in that condition. For an explanation of how violations relate to other basic alerts concepts, see Concepts and workflow. You can view a summary of the violations for a selected incident's page. You can also view the violations for a specific entity from the product's UI. web external Web external is the term applied to the portion of time spent in transactions to external applications from within the code of the application you are monitoring. That time can be a call to a third party company (a payment provider, for example) or it could be a call to another microservice within your own company. Web external demonstrates how performance is impacted by your code executing outside the application you are measuring. web transaction A transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in an application. This term primarily refers to server-side transactions monitored by APM. Web transactions are initiated with an HTTP request. For most organizations, these represent customer-centric interactions and thus are the most important transactions to monitor. For more information, see Web transactions and Non-web transactions. WebDriverJS WebDriver is a Selenium component, used to control Synthetics scripted browsers. Specifically, Synthetics uses WebDriverJS, a Node.js-based flavor of Selenium. For more information, see Writing scripted browsers and Scripted browser examples. workload A workload represents a group of entities that work together to provide a digital service. For more information, see Workloads.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

If you’re on our original pricing model, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing model works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing model that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing model are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full platform users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full platform user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full platform user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full platform user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full platform users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full platform users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full platform users for that month. A full platform user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full platform user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full platform user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full platform user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full platform user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full platform users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full platform user or converted to a full platform user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing model includes one free full platform user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full platform user in another account. In such cases, the full platform user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full platform user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full platform user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing model. If you’re on our original pricing model, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing model works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing model that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing model are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full platform users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full platform user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full platform user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full platform user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full platform users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full platform users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full platform users for that month. A full platform user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full platform user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full platform user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full platform user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full platform user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full platform users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full platform user or converted to a full platform user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing model includes one free full platform user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full platform user in another account. In such cases, the full platform user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full platform user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full platform user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing model. If you’re on our original pricing model, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing model works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing model that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing model are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full platform users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full platform user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full platform user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full platform user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full platform users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full platform users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full platform users for that month. A full platform user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full platform user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full platform user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full platform user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full platform user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full platform users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full platform user or converted to a full platform user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing model includes one free full platform user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full platform user in another account. In such cases, the full platform user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full platform user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full platform user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI.

      "body": "New Relic lets you set up automated user management (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from an identity provider, like Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin. Benefits Before reading the benefits of automated user management, we recommend reading Get started with SAML SSO and SCIM. Benefits of enabling automated user management include: Time and cost efficiency: When you make changes in your identity provider, such as creating, updating, and removing users, these changes are automatically reflected in New Relic. By being able to manage a large set of users from your identity provider, it reduces the workload of your admins who'd otherwise need to do a significant amount of work in New Relic to accomplish the same thing. Increased productivity: By having a more automatic way to set up users and groups, they're enabled and ready to use New Relic more quickly. Enhanced security: SCIM is an industry standard protocol for maintaining groups of users. Use of this feature requires SAML SSO, so once your users are added to New Relic, they can log in using your identity provider. Popular identity providers Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin have dedicated New Relic apps, improving ease of enablement. Requirements and recommendations Requirements and recommendations: Requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. User model-related requirements: This feature requires you to be on our New Relic One user model and creates users on that model. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Configuration requires that a user have the Authentication domain manager and the Organization manager role (users in the default group Admin have these). There are three identity providers that have a New Relic app: Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin. For other identity providers, you can use our SCIM API. Before enabling this, it helps to first set up user groups in your identity provider service and think about which New Relic roles and accounts those groups will have access to. Set up automated user management For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: Use the authentication domain UI to enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. See the SCIM API tutorial for all the steps involved. Highly recommended: Set a time zone for your users in your identity provider. How you do this will vary by identity provider. If not set in your identity provider, our UI shows UTC time zone dates/times. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). If you have issues, contact your account representative. After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic. To learn more about New Relic's roles and capabilities, see Standard roles.",

Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "New Relic lets you set up automated user management (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from an identity provider, like Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin. Benefits Before reading the benefits of automated user management, we recommend reading Get started with SAML SSO and SCIM. Benefits of enabling automated user management include: Time and cost efficiency: When you make changes in your identity provider, such as creating, updating, and removing users, these changes are automatically reflected in New Relic. By being able to manage a large set of users from your identity provider, it reduces the workload of your admins who'd otherwise need to do a significant amount of work in New Relic to accomplish the same thing. Increased productivity: By having a more automatic way to set up users and groups, they're enabled and ready to use New Relic more quickly. Enhanced security: SCIM is an industry standard protocol for maintaining groups of users. Use of this feature requires SAML SSO, so once your users are added to New Relic, they can log in using your identity provider. Popular identity providers Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin have dedicated New Relic apps, improving ease of enablement. Requirements and recommendations Requirements and recommendations: Requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. User model-related requirements: This feature requires you to be on our New Relic One user model and creates users on that model. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Configuration requires that a user have the Authentication domain manager and the Organization manager role (users in the default group Admin have these). There are three identity providers that have a New Relic app: Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin. For other identity providers, you can use our SCIM API. Before enabling this, it helps to first set up user groups in your identity provider service and think about which New Relic roles and accounts those groups will have access to. Set up automated user management For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: Use the authentication domain UI to enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. See the SCIM API tutorial for all the steps involved. Highly recommended: Set a time zone for your users in your identity provider. How you do this will vary by identity provider. If not set in your identity provider, our UI shows UTC time zone dates/times. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). If you have issues, contact your account representative. After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic.

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user type (basic versus full platform) and other information, and approve user type upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Want to see videos of the user management UI in action? See our user management videos. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts If your organization has Pro or Enterprise edition, you can create and configure access grants. An access grant gives a group of users access to a specific role on a specific account. Here's a diagram showing how access grants work and how they relate to the broader organization: A diagram explaining the concept of how access grants give a user group access to a) a role on b) a specific account. (Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model).) When your New Relic organization is created, it starts out with some default access grants for our default User or Admin groups. Each of these groups is assigned one or more roles and granted access to the primary (first created) account: A view of the Organization and access UI, showing the default access grants associated with our default groups. If you have a relatively flat organizational structure, and are okay with all or many of your users having wide administrative access and access to all accounts, you'll probably only need at most a few access grants. For example, you might decide to add new access grants to the existing default Admin or User groups, giving those roles access to other accounts. Or, if you need more granular definition over roles and permissions, you'd create access grants that define new groups that have access to specific roles (either our standard roles or custom-defined roles). For a tutorial on how to create access grants and create custom roles, see the User management tutorial. For other examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. To see the UI in action, see our user management videos. Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? If you've used automated user management to provision users via SCIM, you will have to create access grants to give those users access. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). Common user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create access grants, custom groups, custom roles, and configure an authentication domain. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users See the user management tutorial. Edit user type (basic and full platform) Note that there are limits around how many times full platform users can be changed to basic users. Important If you're using automated user management to provision and manage your users, you have other options for managing user type. To change the user type of one or more users: On the User management page, click the checkboxes for the users whose user type you want to edit. Once you start selecting users, an option will appear for Edit type. You can also edit the user type and group of a specific user by clicking on that user. Give users access to accounts and roles (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See the user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager and Organization manager role. You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can create a custom group and assign it these roles. For a tutorial on creating new access grants, groups, and roles, see the user management tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full platform users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent. User management terms and definitions For an explanation of how user access to accounts and roles works, see User management concepts explained. Here are some definitions for the terms we use there: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. It is what gives a user their permissions. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and to specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full platform user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full platform users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full platform user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple users. To control how basic users upgrade to become full platform users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full platform users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full platform user count If you're on New Relic One pricing model, your count of full platform users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full platform users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full platform users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full platform user This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. The user type (basic user or full platform user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full platform users or request upgrade access from admins. Full platform user (also called full user). Details: Full platform users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full platform user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full platform user in another, the user is considered a full platform user and has full platform user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role. Bulk user management With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Bulk user management troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic.

From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5.

To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain UI. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users.

Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM For how to get to the New Relic authentication domain UI, see Authentication domain. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details. Browser Types of trace data: Session traces Browser traces JavaScript errors* See Browser data retention details. Mobile Types of trace data: App crash stack traces Interaction traces See Mobile data retention details. * JavaScript errors in the stack trace UI are saved as trace data.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing model, not our New Relic One pricing model. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation.",

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details. Browser Types of trace data: Session traces Browser traces JavaScript errors* See Browser data retention details. Mobile Types of trace data: App crash stack traces Interaction traces See Mobile data retention details. * JavaScript errors in the stack trace UI are saved as trace data. JS errors are also saved as events.",

      "body": "Original pricing model This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full platform user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full platform users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full platform user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple users. To control how basic users upgrade to become full platform users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full platform users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full platform user count If you're on New Relic One pricing model, your count of full platform users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full platform users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full platform users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full platform user This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. The user type (basic user or full platform user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full platform users or request upgrade access from admins. Full platform user (also called full user). Details: Full platform users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full platform user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full platform user in another, the user is considered a full platform user and has full platform user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role. Bulk user management With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Bulk user management troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

Requirements: Pro or Enterprise edition. SCIM provisioning, also referred to as automated user management: SCIM provisioning allows organizations to use their identity provider service to automate how their users are added to and updated in New Relic. By definition, SCIM provisioning requires use of SAML SSO, but SAML SSO doesn't require SCIM. Requirements: Pro or Enterprise edition, and organization must be on the New Relic One user model (more on that below). Before enabling these, it's important to understand another major factor that affects these features: which user model your organization is on. In 2020, we released a new and improved user model, called the New Relic One user model. At first mainly new customers made use of this model, but now it’s available to some of our older customers via a user migration procedure. Over time, all users will be migrated to this model. For information on how to enable SAML and SCIM, choose your user model below. If you’re not sure which you’re on, see Overview of user model. New Relic One user model If your organization is on the New Relic One user model, you'll use the authentication domain UI to set up SAML and SCIM. Note that Okta, OneLogin, and Azure have dedicated New Relic apps: if you use those, you must choose the one called \"New Relic by organization\", and not \"New Relic by account\". Original user model If your organization is on the original user model, we recommend migrating your users via the self-serve migration procedure if you’re able to. If you don’t meet the requirements but want to enable SAML and/or SCIM, please speak to your New Relic account representative. Here are some tips and docs links: SAML: If you want to or must stay on the original user model and can’t migrate to the new model, see our original SAML docs. SCIM + SAML: SCIM provisioning creates users on the new model. This is why your organization must first switch to the new user model before using SCIM.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Original pricing model This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move and store your data in the US region. New Relic CodeStream operates solely in the US. Whether you have selected New Relic's US or EU region data center during setup of your New Relic account, when using New Relic CodeStream, you consent that your New Relic CodeStream data will get stored in the US. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

      "body": "New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode). For more information about our security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Requirements Customers on our New Relic One pricing model require Enterprise edition. Customers on our original pricing model have access depending on their subscription level. Account level If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account. Currently there are two versions of high security mode. Version 1 is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). Agent Version 2 support C SDK n/a Go All versions Java 3.7 or higher (enabled by default) .NET 3.3 or higher Node.js 1.7.0 or higher PHP 4.9 or higher Python 2.22.0.0 or higher Ruby 3.9.1 or higher Enable high security mode (version 2) To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server and the remote configuration in the UI. Caution Once you enable high security for an account, high security cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. Setting location Description Set in UI For users on our original user model: Only the account owner can configure this. Go to one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown and select Account settings. On that page, select High security mode. For users on the New Relic One user model: Get the account ID for the account you want to enable. Then use that to go to this URL: https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID. On that page, you can configure high security mode. If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections are rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application. Local, via agent Enable high security mode in your agent configuration file. High security mode is disabled by default, and the exact procedure to enable it varies by agent: C SDK: n/a Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby If the agent is configured for high security locally but not via the UI, then the agent connections will be rejected, and the agent will shut down. This will not shut down your application. Results of enabling high security mode (version 2) Once enabled, high security mode (v2) ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires a secure (HTTPS) connection. Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure all data in transit per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture High security mode does not allow HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send HTTP params locally or through server-side configuration, high security mode will override the configuration to never capture HTTP params. Prevents message queue param capture High security mode does not allow message queue params, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be sent to the New Relic collector. If the agent is configured to send message queue params locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture message queue params. Prevents raw query statement capture High security mode does not allow raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, to be captured. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, then high security mode will override the configuration to never capture raw queries. Prevents user attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's API to be captured, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, String value) Copy NewRelic.addCustomParameter(String key, Number value) Copy NewRelic.setUserName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setAccountName(String name) Copy NewRelic.setProductName(String name) Copy Prevents noticeError attribute capture High security mode does not allow attributes set using each agent's noticeError API call to be captured as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the Java agent, attributes passed in through the following NewRelic agent API calls will be blocked: NewRelic.noticeError(String message, Map<String, String> params) Copy NewRelic.noticeError(Throwable throwable, Map<String, String> params) Copy Prevents custom events High security mode does not allow custom events to be created using the agent API, as these may contain sensitive customer data. For example, in the .NET agent, the API call RecordCustomEvent will be blocked. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Results of enabling high security mode v1 (deprecated) High security mode version 1 is deprecated and only available if you enabled it prior to version 2 being available. High security mode version 1 ensures the following for your account: Feature Comments Requires agents to use a secure connection (HTTPS) High security mode requires an encrypted connection (HTTPS). Non-secure connection attempts will be rejected. The latest version of all New Relic agents support HTTPS. If the configuration is not set appropriately, the agent will override the property to ensure that all data in transit is encrypted as per the latest industry standards. Prevents HTTP param capture Agents configured to capture HTTP params, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the local configuration is set to capture request parameters, then New Relic's collector will reject the connection, and the agent will shut down. Prevents raw query statement capture Agents configured to capture raw database query statements, which may contain sensitive customer data, are not allowed to connect to New Relic. If the agent is configured to capture raw queries locally or through server-side configuration, New Relic's collector will reject the connection and the agent will shut down. Prevents deploying Custom Instrumentation via CIE High security mode does not allow deploying custom instrumentation when using the Custom Instrumentation Editor. If you have high security mode enabled, you must export the instrumentation and manually import it to your app server. Migrate from version 1 to version 2 These are the main differences between the two versions of high security: In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface and in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI. User attributes, noticeError attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1. To update from v1 to v2, add high_security: true to your local agent configuration file.",

      "body": "To view workloads, go to one.newrelic.com and find them on the Explorer. There are three main tabs (Health, Activity, and Owner) plus the header. Health The Health tab in a workload provides relevant status data that helps you operate the workload: It shows the global status of the workload, as well as the individual status of all the entities that make up the workload at each point in time. It looks like this: It comprises the following: The navigator view shows the entities that make up the workload, and provides controls to group and sort them. If you’ve used queries to dynamically select entities, the workload entities will change over time. The workload status informs about how your workload is performing, based on the individual alerting status of the entities in your workload. With health over time you’ll see whether and how the workload status has changed in the past three hours. If one or more entities are alerting, you’ll get a count of criticals and warnings and a summary of the open conditions, which will make it easier to identify and troubleshoot the most important issues. Activity The Activity tab shows performance data related to the entities in the workload, along with the events that could explain any changes in those time series. It looks like this: Here are the most important sections: Linked dashboards. You can add links to dashboards from your workload, and create pre-filtered, workload-relevant links to dashboards. Golden metrics. These are charts with the most relevant metrics for each entity type, such as number of requests, response time, and error rate for an application. Explore the charts to detect correlations among different entities (for example, two applications) and different stack layers (for example, applications and hosts). The golden metrics that you see for each entity type on a workload can be customized either at the account or the workload level through the NerdGraph API. Events timeline. This includes the start and end time of incidents and anomalies that refer to the workload entities. It also shows other event types that can explain a change in the status or performance of the workload, such as deployments and configuration changes. You can control which golden metrics are used to visualize your workload entities by using the golden metrics API. To learn more, watch this short video (approx. 4 minutes). Owner The Owner tab gives you information about the team responsible for the workload. It looks like this: It contains: The team responsible for the workload. You can include more than one team. The workload description. Share the mission of the workload, and the business logic it represents: Is it a web application? An API? A backend process? Fill in any details that are relevant to your team, or to other teams in your organization. Contact information. From the drop-down menu, choose how your team prefers to be contacted. Links to the most relevant resources to operate the workload. Here you can add links to runbooks, code repositories, productivity tools, or anything else related to the workload that you need at hand. Header The header contains the filter bar and the edition controls: Filter bar. Use the advanced filtering options when you need to focus only on certain entities within the workload. Edit workload. Define the entities that are part of the workload, and the accounts they’ll be fetched from. Setup status. Configure how the global workload status will be determined, based on the workload entities health. Summary page. See all the tags that have been added to the workload, as well as metadata such as the workload's identifier (GUID) and account. You can create workloads that update dynamically by leveraging tags. To learn how, watch this short video (approx. 3 minutes). Create a workload A workload should contain the entities you and your team want to see. Your choice of entities depends on your organization structure and goals. one.newrelic.com > Explorer > Workloads > Create a workload: When you create a workload, you choose the associated accounts and monitored entities. You can use New Relic One or the NerdGraph API to create a workload. Follow these steps to create a workload using the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com and click on the Explorer, and then click + Create a workload. Give the workload a name that will be meaningful for you and your team later. From the Select an account dropdown, select the workload account you'd like to use. Click Choose the scope accounts to check all of the accounts related to this workload. Find and choose the entities that make up the workload. When you have the results you're looking for, you can add specific entities or add the query to dynamically update the entities in the workload. You can search by entity type, tags, or attributes (like entity name, account ID, and AWS region). Click + Add this query to create a list of dynamically updated entities for your workload. We recommend this if you want your workload to update its entities as your system changes. Click + Add next to an entity to add it to your workload. This is a good choice if you know that the entities will stay useful even as your system changes. You can add a combination of queries and specific entities to the workload, which combine according to the query logic. Click Create a workload to save the workload. Once you've created the workload, you can edit it at any time If your workload contains one or more dashboards, you can set filters on those dashboard links. Below are more details about some aspects of how to define workloads: Use tags to define the workload content You can query and select workload entities using both tags and attributes. Therefore, to optimize your use of workloads, it helps to have a good entity-tagging strategy. We recommend reading the tagging documentation. How the dynamic query logic works You can add several individual entities and queries to define a workload. Queries can include multiple search terms. These are combined with an AND operator. Separate queries within a workload are combined with an OR operator. You can wrap strings between percent signs (%) to match exact substrings within a query. If you use substrings in entity names to categorize those entities (for example, <team>-<env>-<appName>), consider using tags complementarily, which are more powerful for filtering and grouping (for example, team:awesome, env:production). We recommend not to use percent signs (%) in dynamic queries that might return over 500 entities. This way, you get a more consistent experience in the user interface. Add dashboards to workloads If you have custom dashboards and you already know which data is relevant to your team for observing and operating their workloads, you can link those dashboards from your workload. You can also set filters on dashboards to scope them to a workload-specific context. When a user selects that dashboard from the workload, it opens with the filter already applied. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can add dashboards to a workload. To add dashboards to a workload: When creating or editing a workload, type Dashboard in the workload search bar to filter to dashboard entities. Add other search terms to filter to specific dashboards. Click Add. one.newrelic.com > Apps > Workloads: You can set filters on the dashboards you've linked to a workload. To filter a workload’s dashboard: From a workload’s Overview page, select a dashboard. Add search terms to filter the dashboard to a view that’s relevant for that workload. Select Save filter for this workload. Use the API You can query, create, and update workloads with our NerdGraph API.",

      "body": "In the software industry, a tag typically refers to a piece of metadata added to a data set for the purpose of improving data organization and findability. At New Relic, our tags are key:value pairs (like team: operations) added to various sets of data, like monitored apps and hosts, agents, dashboards, and workloads. We make some important attributes available as tags (for example, app metadata like app name and language, and host metadata like host name and AWS region). You can also add your own custom tags. You can use tags in the UI to filter down to relevant data. Here is an example: Here you can see an accountId tag being used to filter workloads to a specific account. Tags help you to: Organize data coming from a large number of sources and/or to a large number of New Relic accounts. Identify teams, roles, environments, or regions to know who’s responsible for what (see example use cases). Better organize and search dashboards and workloads. Query and chart APM data. Tags are useful for organizing data at a high level. If you want to add more fine-grained detail, like capturing user names or other high-cardinality values, custom attributes or custom events are a better solution. Tip Tags were previously called labels in the New Relic UI. You may sometimes see labelin our code; for example, some of our APM agent config files use a label config option for tags. Tag format and limits Format requirements and limits for tags: The UI has limits on the total number of tags it can display per entity: Limit of 100 for tags reported by default or added via agent/integration configuration. Limit of 100 for custom tags added via UI or API. The following are maximum character length for tags: Key: 128 characters Value: 256 characters Allowed characters: Characters must be UTF-8. When using NerdGraph to add tags, a dash (-) in a tag key is interpreted as a minus symbol. If your tag key has a dash, use back ticks around it (like `key-name`). Best practices and tips Before adding tags, we recommend first seeing how our default tags work for you. When you're ready to add your own tags, review the following best practices tips to get the most out of them. Tips on keeping tags simple: Start by adding only tags you know you’ll definitely use. Unused tags create noise and may add confusion. Try to use short tags. Shorter tags are easier to parse, and also the UI may sometimes truncate longer tags. (See character limits.) When possible, use keys and values that are human-readable (for example, region: EMEA is better than Param8323 : 1229072). Avoid including several values like regions: EMEA | US | LATAM in a single tag. We recommend using three different tags for that, like region: emea, region: us, and region: latam. If you want to match multiple tags, you can do that using the advanced options in the filter UI. Tips on using tags consistently: Try to be consistent with tag language across your teams and entities. Be consistent with naming. For example, avoid using both region: emea and reg: emea. Be consistent with format. For example, avoid using both camelCase and kebab-case. Although tag searching is not case-sensitive in the UI and API, try to be consistent with capitalization. For example, avoid using both env: staging and env: Staging. Tips on cross-team implementation: Tags help improve observability and cost allocation. For this reason, responsibility for tag implementation is often assigned to an observability team, SREs, a group of architects, or a cross-team task force. We recommend the people responsible for implementing tags meet and create an internal policy to describe how the tags are defined and which conventions are to be used. Then: Keep this reference manual up to date. Automate the definition of tags when you deploy New Relic agents, at the cloud provider, or through New Relic automation tools, such as the API or Terraform. Create recurring reports that identify entities that are non-compliant with your tagging standards. Tag examples Here are some examples of common ways to use tags to organize data: Team-related tags Creating tags for team names can be helpful to understand which team, group, department, or region was responsible for a change that led to a performance issue. Team examples: team: backend team: frontend team: db Role examples: roles: architecture roles: devops roles: pm Region examples: region: emea region: america region: asia Environment-related tags You can create entities for the environment they belong to. Examples: env: production env: qa env: development env: staging Criticality-related tags You can create tags related to criticality levels, which lets you easier track the most critical issues. Examples: layer: level1 layer: level2 layer: level3 How tags are added Some important attributes, by default, are available for use as tags. For example, the account name, the account ID, and some basic host/server metadata are available as default tags. You can't remove these available-by-default tags. Here are some details about how tags are added for some specific data sources: Add tags via UI or API When you add tags via the UI or API, this occurs at the entity level. This means that, for example, if you have multiple APM agents monitoring a single entity and apply a tag via the UI, that tag is available for all data coming from that entity. To add or delete tags via the UI: Select a monitored entity, like a monitored app or host. Near the entity’s name at the top of the page, select the See metadata and manage tags menu. In the menu that pops up, add or delete a tag. For APM agents, restart your service. To manage tags via API: see our NerdGraph tagging docs. For a guide to using our CLI to automate tagging, see our developer site. APM agent tags You can add tags via the UI and API or you can add tags using APM agent configuration, both methods require you to restart your service. There are differences in how these apply tags: Via agent config: These tags are applied at the agent-level, not the entity/application level. This would be a good option if you have multiple agents monitoring different aspects of the same app (for example, a blue-green deployment model). Via the UI or API: These tags are applied at the entity/application level. Here are links to the agent configuration options: C SDK: not available Java Go .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby For information on querying APM tags, see Query APM tags. And check out this short video on querying APM tags (3:20 minutes). Infrastructure data tags There are several ways tags are added to infrastructure entities and services: Use the UI or API to add tags at the entity level. Infrastructure agent: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add custom attributes, which are also available as tags in the UI. On-host integrations: some attributes are available by default as tags. You can also add tags by using integration-specific labels config options (for an example, see the labels config for the Apache integration). Cloud service integrations: by default we report tags and labels that are defined in the cloud service. To add tags, you'd add them on the cloud-service-side. Automate tags with our CLI For a guide to automating tags using our CLI tool, see our developer site. Use tags to filter the UI Use the filter field at the top of the New Relic Explorer to filter down to the entities you care about. You can use multiple filter conditions. To filter down to certain entities using tags: From one.newrelic.com, click Explorer. Click the Filter by... field to see a dropdown of available attributes and tags. You can filter by multiple elements and use advanced search options. To find an entity’s metadata and tags from the UI, here are two options: From a list of entities in the UI, at the far right, select an entity's icon. OR Select an entity. Near the top of the page, select the icon. To use the API to view tags, see our NerdGraph docs. Learn about how to use tags with dashboards and how to use tags with workloads. Custom queries, charts, and alerts Different features handle tags differently. Here are some details about how you can use NRQL to query tag data, or create NRQL condition alerts. Query and alert on APM tags You can query APM tags using NRQL. Minimum agent versions: C: not available Go: 2.3.0 Java: 4.9.0 .NET: 8.17 Node: v4.13.0 PHP: not available Python: v4.10.0.112 Ruby: 6.1.0.352 Here are some query examples: Throughput across shards Given a service that is distributed across nine shards, each shard assigned as an environment, we can plot the transaction throughput on all shards using a wildcard query like: SELECT rate(count(apm.service.transaction.duration), 1 minute) FROM Metric WHERE appName LIKE 'MyApp (%' AND transactionType = 'Other' FACET tags.Environment TIMESERIES Copy Transactions per team To see the number of transactions per service for a specific team, we might use a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-a' FACET tags.Project TIMESERIES Copy Alert on error rate for teams You can use a query for your services’ error rate for setting an alert without having to create a rule for each service. Here is the error rate for all services on a team called team-b. And this alert will automatically monitor any new app names added with the team tag. FROM Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Team = 'team-b' FACET appName Copy Related to this, you might create a general rule for a specific service deployed across several environments, so that we have an alarm for a single service monitoring each environment individually: From Metric SELECT count(apm.service.error.count) / count(apm.service.transaction.duration) WHERE tags.Project = 'MyProject' FACET tags.Environment Copy Query and alert on attributes As explained in the tag sources information, some important attributes are used as tags. You can query all attributes and create custom charts using NRQL, and create NRQL alert conditions.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or SCIM provisioning today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. User assets include: Dashboards Favorites Weekly email settings Email opt in/out preferences User-specific user keys New Relic One apps NerdStorage data If a user has access to several organizations that use New Relic (for example, if that user is a contractor), their original user model record won't be fully deleted until all those organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will have both an original user record and one or more new user records and this will be displayed upon login (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing model, not our New Relic One pricing model. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Original pricing model This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Original pricing model This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing model, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing models. If you're on the original product-based pricing model, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, go to the Data management UI. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking Edit retention. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in APM, mobile, and browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested. Mobile Crash rate: For iOS and for Android Network throughput Network response time Network error rates Interaction traces Trace data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Depending on the product, New Relic retains different types of trace data: Product Trace data APM Types of trace data: Transaction traces Distributed tracing Slow query samples Error details See APM data retention details.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing model and a newer user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing model and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained User models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing model and user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing model and a new, improved user model. These models represent the future. All new sign-ups are on these new models and eventually all organizations will be on these models. But currently, our customers from before July 2020 may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors User model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing model until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing model: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing models: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing model is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full platform users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing model, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing model. Our original product-based pricing model: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing model: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing model To determine which pricing model you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing model. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some organizations are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing model. User models explained In this context, the term \"user model\" refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing model. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing model is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and organizations using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing model. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be not obvious to users accustomed to our previous user model: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. You can't use the REST API to generate a list of users (only original model users). Instead you'd use the user management UI. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic organizations on the old models are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Original pricing model This doc is for users on our original user model. New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts for users on our original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "All of our sprint work is tracked in Jira. The workflow depends on what type of work we're dealing with: Planned or unplanned (\"surprise!\") work. Planned work Planned work includes all work that is currently in our backlog or has been added to the current sprint as a result of a Sprint Planning session. This could include writing or updating documentation, research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Unplanned work (surprises!) Usually, we get notified of major requests far enough in advance that we can include them in liaison project plans, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. Occasionally, something bigger surprises us that needs emergency support. Follow this process with new docs asks to assess the scope of work and ensure we address valid docs needs within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal is to treat the sprint as sacred and insulate against \"surprise\" work that is not absolutely crucial. But we also want to ensure we're providing good internal customer service, and not getting hung up on process niceties for things that are small. Jira boards: Backlog and future sprints This is where the vast majority of tickets spend their time. Most tickets (even for active projects) spend at least a little time here before moving into a sprint to be actively worked. Being in the backlog doesn't mean something isn't important---just that we haven't committed to it yet.  You can also add tickets straight to a future sprint. This is where tickets tentatively assigned to a future sprint will be found. Tickets can be assigned here to be held for backlog grooming and sprint planning.  Jira boards: Current sprint Proposed This step is for work that has been assigned to the current sprint during Sprint Planning and is available to be picked up by a tech writer. When you're ready to take on a new ticket, try to work the queue from the top-down and avoid cherry picking. It's also better to pick up Needs Peer Edit tickets before committing to a new ticket. Something that needs a peer edit is close to done, and helping things across the finish line helps get value into users hands, and frees us up to think about new problems. In Progress This step is for all of the work to be done by the assignee: Research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, writing, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Tickets are moved to this step once work is started by the TW, and remain here until the work is either complete, ready for peer review, or it becomes blocked. If additional large edits are needed after the peer review, the ticket can be moved back to In Progress for those edits. Needs Peer Editor Work that is ready for a peer edit. Once a peer editor picks it up, they move it into In Peer Edit. In Peer Edit This step is for a peer editor to review docs before they go live. Follow the Peer editor workflow, then move the ticket into Peer Edit Done.  Peer Edit Done This step is a holding state once peer editing is complete. After completing their peer edit and delivering their feedback, the peer editor moves the ticket into Peer Edit Done. From there, the assignee on the ticket (not the peer editor) moves the ticket into the appropriate column (In Progress, Blocked, or Closed). Minor edits can be completed from this column but for major doc rework, the ticket should be moved back into the In Progress column. Blocked This step is for tickets that cannot be moved forward by the team. This could be because we're waiting for a response from a SME, or for a feature to deploy, or for final signoff. The team keeps an eye on this column for tickets that may need escalation. Putting something in Blocked rather than In Progress lets us see the status of every ticket at a glance. This column can also be used for extended time out of the office for the assigned writer, if it's work that can be safely held. (If the work cannot be held while you're out, find another writer to step in and take over.) Once you're un-blocked, move the ticket to the appropriate column. If the ticket remains blocked at the end of the current sprint, it will need to be re-reviewed during backlog grooming to determine if the ticket will carry-over into the upcoming sprint, or return to the backlog until a future sprint. Done This step is for work that is 100% finished. Work gets cleared out this column before we start a new sprint. Incomplete (\"carry-over\") tickets Ticket don't carry over automatically between sprints. Instead, any ticket that gets carried over is treated as a \"new\" ticket in the next sprint planning. Before sprint planning, review any open tickets in the board that are assigned to you and figure out what to do with them. For each open ticket assigned to you (or \"carry over\"), decide if you should: Recommended: Clone the ticket and close the old one. This is the best option for partially completed work because it makes metrics easier. If you do: Clone the ticket. Note why we closed the ticket. Add an estimate of points completed in the Points Completed field. Create a follow-up ticket if necessary. Move the ticket to the next sprint. If you do: Review the ticket's action items and description to make sure they're still current. Clear out the ticket points. Move the ticket back to the backlog. If you do: Update the action items and description to make sure they're still current. Note why we moved to the backlog rather than carry over. ← Planning poker Liaisonships → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

The new sprint starts on a Tuesday with sprint planning, where we commit to a set of stories that we're confident we can complete by the end of the sprint. Near the end of the sprint, we prepare for the next sprint with backlog grooming. The sprint closes with a retro where we discuss what went right and what went wrong, and then we kick off a new cycle. Each squad does their own backlog grooming and sprint planning, and manages their sprint backlog independently. We do retros together so we can talk through issues that affect both squads and share expertise and ideas. Tip Why do we end sprints on Mondays and start Tuesdays? This funny schedule makes things easier to work across timezones. If we ended sprints on Fridays, our Barcelona-based writers would need to do retros and grooming on Friday evening, and who wants that? Sprint planning On the first Tuesday of a new sprint, we commit to a series of stories until we have filled our capacity for the sprint. This is the largest meeting in the sprint---about 60 to 90 minutes. Before the sprint planning meeting, the scrum master for each squad calculates their point budget. Then, during the meeting: We select the highest priority item in the backlog. The person who nominated the story introduces it, and the team asks questions until everyone feels ready to vote. The team plays planning poker. Everyone secretly chooses a card, then we reveal them at the same time: If everyone picks the same card, that's the point value and we move on. If there's an even split between two cards, we choose the larger and move on. If it's mixed, the highest and lowest voters briefly explain their votes. Then we vote again. Once we're sure we can fit the story in, we subtract its story points from the sprint's points budget. We repeat the above steps until we've used up our points budget. We generally avoid pre-assigning people to stories during sprint planning. Instead, we pick up the next story or peer edit in the To Do column as stories are completed. Backlog grooming The day before the sprint starts, we do two rounds of backlog grooming. The purpose of backlog grooming is to prioritize work for sprint planning, and identify stories that need to be fixed before sprint planning to ensure scope is clear and planning runs smoothly. The first round of backlog grooming is by squad, where the members and manager of the squad get together and work through the grooming checklist. Then we do a second round of grooming with the managers and scrum masters to look at the sprint backlog for both squads and ensure nothing is or has fallen through the cracks. In the grooming, we: Each writer brings their personal \"top five\" tickets. The manager works with writers to prioritize those into a single, stack-ranked list for the team. We talk through stories and ensure they look ready for sprint planning (essentially, do they fit the Checklist for story readiness?). After grooming, the scrum master sends out a list of \"homework\" for stories that need improving. Retro Every other sprint, we conduct a 60 minute retrospective meeting, where we discuss: How do we feel about the sprint? What went well? Where can we improve? Anything we should start or stop doing? The goal of the retro is to improve the way we work together. That could be related to the sprint process, to how we collaborate with SMEs, to peer edits, and so on. ← Agile roles Planning poker → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "About once a quarter, the Docs team reviews our entire backlog in Jira and GitHub. This ensures that we actually know what's in there, and that we're bubbling up the right stories from the backlog into upcoming sprints. Goals of backlog review Fix easy issues: If you can fix something quickly, just do it. Find broken windows: What are the small (or big!) broken windows lurking in our backlog? What should we consider bubbling up into a future sprint? Identify gaps in the backlog: Discover important issues that are not at all covered in the backlog. Clear out cruft: Find duplicate issues, things we'll never fix, or issues that are just no longer relevant. Check labels and fields: Is the ticket assigned a correct priority score? Do we have the correct labels for other fields? Who reviews the backlog Sometimes we'll involve the whole team in a backlog review; other times, just the managers will handle the review. The most useful time to involve the whole team is when we're onboarding a new writer: Talking through issues promotes a lot of knowledge-sharing about the product, docs, stakeholders, and how to write a good ticket. Otherwise, we'll usually assign the review to the managers. This saves time, and it also tends to make it easier to close out issues (since our managers are also our product owners). If we don't involve the whole team, we'll prepare a spreadsheet of which issues we closed and list writers who might care so they can weigh in on whether the issue should have stayed open. What to look for in a backlog review When you review an issue, perform the following checks: Check if the issue can be closed: It's already resolved, or you can't reproduce the issue It's old, and we have little evidence anyone cares It's not important enough to fix If the issue doesn't have a clear goal/task, try to discover one (but don't feel obligated to rewrite the whole issue). Add context and update as-needed. Review fields and labels and ensure they're accurate. Add a label to the issue once you're done with your review. Use this format: year_month_backlog_review. For example: 2021_october_backlog_review. This helps keep track of which issues you've reviewed on this round of backlog review It's also a useful nudge for future round of review: If an issue has more than one or two review labels, you should probably close it. ← Appendix: Project scoping cheatsheet Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "Jira, a project management tool made by Atlassian, is how we manage our projects and understand the work we are doing and have done. Jira tickets may seem at first to be simple to-do lists that we use to know what things to do for a project. But they are much more important than that. Tip For Relics: Use the docs.newrelic.com/jira template when you create a ticket! It'll automatically pre-fill your ticket with a template that helps create a good ticket. Why do we use Jira? We create tickets to record work-to-be done for a project, scope new work, share information for any writer to complete a story, forecast our output and to estimate project timelines, and have a record of work done. In other words, Jira has a role at every point in a project: Before a project Scoping, syncing on expectations, giving tech writer instructions During a project Keeps team and management posted about project; allows for hand-offs and swarming After a project Understand what work we did, and helps researching on future projects What work needs a ticket? There aren't hard-and-fast rules about what work needs a Jira ticket and what doesn't. A good shorthand is that any project that takes more than a couple hours is a good candidate for a ticket. However, the goal of creating tickets is not to track writer time in detail. So many kinds of work (meetings, ongoing minor liaison tasks, hero work) generally do not need to go into Jira. Keeping tickets up-to-date In general, you should write your tickets as though you might win the lottery tomorrow (a principle known as lottery factor or bus factor). In practice, someone should be able to read your ticket and figure out within about ten minutes what the status is and what the next step is. This makes it easy for us to take vacations, pass work off to another docs writer if needed, and escalate blockers. These things help with lottery factor: Update the Action Item list as you complete tasks and add or remove scope. When you move a ticket to Blocked, include a note explaining the change in status. When you close a ticket, give a summary of the work done and any relevant thoughts you have on the work and potential related issues. Update the Timeline, People, and Resources sections as the project evolves. Add important conversations (emails or Slack convos from SMEs) that give important context for the work done. (Note: It's a good idea to ask permission before doing this, because some people might not like their informal words placed in a public place.) Add Jira context to PRs and commits When you edit the site, include the Jira issue key (DOC-1234, for example) in your pull request title and/or commit summary. That makes it easier for other writers to connect the dots later if we're trying to figure out why something changed or who knows about a particular subject. Checklist for writing a good ticket Helpful title A ticket name should be easy to find via search, understand the work at a glance, mention the product or feature, and describe the goal or issue. Examples of good ticket titles: Browser API: Update custom attribute-related docs or Distributed tracing: Add more detail about CAT relationship. Action items An action item list describing the work to be done What docs are affected Links to pull requests, Google Docs drafts, etc. How substantial the writing work is in each doc How the resulting work should be structured Whether or not a peer edit is needed Anyone who should be notified when a doc is published Proper sizing Story is scoped to the smallest reasonable size Can be completed within a 2 week sprint Delivers incremental value Dates Publication date or due date Dates for other key events (betas, limited releases, etc.) Resources and people People, including last names and roles List of related or affected docs Other internal and external resources Related issues Labels and fields Jira tickets: Component, Product Group, and Priority GitHub issues: from_, pg_, and content labels ← Managing the GitHub boards Appendix: Project scoping cheatsheet → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "For large projects, we'll typically assign a particular tech writer to that project as a \"liaison.\" The liaison’s job is to ensure that we get complete, consistent, and timely docs. Not every project gets a liaisonship! For smaller projects, we'll encourage teams to edit the docs directly, and then have the hero review their changes. And a smallish project may not need a full liaison—a single ticket might be enough to manage the work. To figure out which type of support is best for a given project, one of the managers on the team will have a scoping conversation with a subject matter expert. Here's a few reasons a project might get a dedicated liaison: Project is complex and would benefit from intimate familiarity with the feature. Project requires significant information architecture work. Project will produce enough docs that consistency across those docs will be hard to achieve without a centralized editor. Project SMEs would benefit from a consistent \"face\" of the tech writing team. However, a liaison is not the only author on a project. Liaisons should structure their work to maximize swarming and knowledge sharing. Liaison responsibilities: Manage project flow Activity Who? Notes Learn new thing exists Team Ideally the Hero or a Tech Docs manager gets notified directly by a PM about a new project. But sometimes we'll find out about something unexpectedly. If you're not sure whether we have a writer working on something, ask a manager on the team and they'll reach out to the subject matter expert to scope it. Have a scoping meeting Tech Docs manager The manager is responsible for tracking the general state of major projects across the company, and is generally the first point of contact for new projects. When a large new project comes up, the manager will do a pre-scope meeting with the requestor. (Appendix: Project scoping cheatsheet has a list of common questions for this pre-scope meeting.) That conversation helps figure out timeline, complexity, key docs considerations, and which writer will be a good fit as liaison. Assign a liaison Tech Docs manager Once we know we need a liaison, a manager on our team will figure out who to assign. Some of the factors we use to decide who to assign include bandwidth, familiarity with the product or feature, career goals and writing strengths, and simple interest in the topic. Keep track of project dates Liaison The managers on the team keep track of upcoming projects that don't have a liaison assigned. Once a writer gets involved, that liaison keeps track of the specifics of dates: Betas, limited releases, GAs, fast-follows, and so on. Your manager's always here to help out if you're getting blocked or dates are shifting too rapidly to plan properly. Validate the docs plan with the project team Liaison The liaison works with their stakeholders to define the information architecture and deliverables. Create tickets Liaison Since the liaison defines the information architecture, the liaison will know what kinds of deliverables we need. The liaison also acts as an advocate for their tickets in the backlog grooming and sprint planning processes, and ensures their stories meet the story quality requirements. The liaison should also ensure that our partner teams have appropriate tickets in their backlogs for their work. Remove blockers (such as reviewer delay) Liaison + Manager While the liaison is primarily responsible for handling SME relationships and removing day-to-day blockers, your manager is here to help unstick things anytime you need help. Wrap up the liaisonship Liaison Liaisonships are not forever assignments! When the bulk of your work on a project is complete, it might be time to consider ending the liaisonship. Reach out to your manager to talk about it. When you end it, let stakeholders know and update the liaison roster. Also let your stakeholders know they can always ping the docs hero for help or if they have a new project. Liaison responsibilities: Build expertise Activity Who? Notes Develop a deep expertise on feature and audience. Liaison Become the Docs Team's local expert on the feature. Understand what it does, what problems it solves, and the implications for our content. Educate the team on the feature Liaison Part of your responsibility as liaison is to share expertise around the team. That helps with swarming, but it also makes for better hero review and a smarter team that can write more intelligently about the entire New Relic One platform. Coordinate with design and/or research and test your docs Liaison Reach out to the designer and/or researcher for the project, and periodically sync on any shared concerns, user needs, etc. And you should advocate for user testing and validation of your content. Liaison responsibilities: Define content strategy (oh, and do the writing) Activity Who? Notes Define the information architecture Liaison As liaison, you're the expert on both the feature the product team is building, and the docs content (new and existing) that will support that feature. Build an IA that will meet all project needs and scale to the future. Write content Team The liaison writes much of the content for their project, especially the conceptual content like intro docs. But the whole team is expected to swarm and contribute to large projects, with the liaison coordinating that work. Peer edit drafts Liaison When we swarm and have someone else contribute to the project, the liaison peer edits their drafts to ensure consistency with the overall vision. Coordinate publication Liaison When the time comes to release (whether that's beta, GA, limited release, or EoL), it's the liaison's job to coordinate with PM, Eng, and Product Marketing to ensure docs go out on time with other deliverables. ← Sprint workflow and Jira boards What is a hero? → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "Our team uses an agile Sprint workflow in Jira and GitHub to manage our work. We've further divided our team into squads to simplify planning and improve accountability. All those words are pretty inconsistent in their usage, so let's break them down further. Agile People use agile to mean everything from a specific system of work (which we call sprints), to just \"moving fast, preferably in a way that lets me bend things to my whims.\" Luckily, we don't need to define it from scratch. Wikipedia does an admirable job defining it: Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, empirical knowledge, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. For our team, that means our process is optimized to ship early and often. This lets us respond swiftly to changes in the product roadmap. More importantly, it ensures we validate our solutions with stakeholders, and that we're not letting valuable work sit around and get moldy when it could be out in the world making our users' lives better. Sprint (or scrum) This is the particular flavor of agile we follow. The sprint system (often referred to as scrum) is one major approach to Agile, along with other Agile systems such as Kanban. Sprint systems are often accompanied by a lot of jargon and best practices, but for our team the most essential elements are: Working in strict timeboxes (two weeks in our case) Planning that sprint in advance, and not changing the scope of the sprint (much) once it starts Expecting all team members to contribute to making the sprint a success The video Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell (18 minutes) is an excellent resource for learning about sprint methodology. The Kindle book Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction is also a great read that you can get through in a short afternoon. For more on the \"why\" of Sprint as our chosen methodology, see Key agile principles. And for more on the \"how,\" see Sprint workflow. Jira and GitHub issues Jira and GitHub issues are the tools we use to manage our Agile workflow. If you remember one thing about them, it should be this: using Jira or GitHub issues is not the same as having an agile workflow. They're powerful tools for tracking work and managing a backlog, but the most important part of project management is the structure we impose on that tool. Jira is for sprint work. Sprints are where roadmap docs get written, monthly commits get delivered, and deeper research percolates. We have a backlog, board, and future sprint list in Jira that help us track what people want, what's coming up, and what we're working on now. For more on the mechanics of how we use Jira, see Sprint workflow and Jira boards and Ticket best practices. We use GitHub projects for hero work, customer-reported issues, and managing the flow of PRs and edits. The Docs PRs and Issues board contains everything we're actively working on in GitHub. We'll often connect work in GitHub back to Jira by putting a Jira issue key in the PR or issue title (DOC-1234, for example). For more on the mechanics of how we use GitHub, see Managing the GitHub boards. Teams and squads Our team is the Tech Docs team. We're collectively responsible for docs.newrelic.com and sundry writing content. Our team is further divided into two agile squads (The Odd Squad and The Amp Squad), one squad for each manager. The primary function of squads is to simplify sprint planning, backlog grooming, and liaisonships. Less people means shorter meetings. It also means better information sharing: The more people you have in a group, the more lines of communication are needed (see illustration) to maintain a shared understanding. Small squads can collaborate more easily than a large team, because not everyone needs to keep in mind everything that goes on everywhere. Each squad is responsible for its own grooming and sprint planning, but the managers and scrum masters coordinate grooming to ensure we're meeting our overall goals as a team.

      "body": "All of our sprint work is tracked in Jira. The workflow depends on what type of work we're dealing with: Planned or unplanned (\"surprise!\") work. Planned work Planned work includes all work that is currently in our backlog or has been added to the current sprint as a result of a Sprint Planning session. This could include writing or updating documentation, research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Unplanned work (surprises!) Usually, we get notified of major requests far enough in advance that we can include them in liaison project plans, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. Occasionally, something bigger surprises us that needs emergency support. Follow this process with new docs asks to assess the scope of work and ensure we address valid docs needs within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal is to treat the sprint as sacred and insulate against \"surprise\" work that is not absolutely crucial. But we also want to ensure we're providing good internal customer service, and not getting hung up on process niceties for things that are small. Jira boards: Backlog and future sprints This is where the vast majority of tickets spend their time. Most tickets (even for active projects) spend at least a little time here before moving into a sprint to be actively worked. Being in the backlog doesn't mean something isn't important---just that we haven't committed to it yet.  You can also add tickets straight to a future sprint. This is where tickets tentatively assigned to a future sprint will be found. Tickets can be assigned here to be held for backlog grooming and sprint planning.  Jira boards: Current sprint Proposed This step is for work that has been assigned to the current sprint during Sprint Planning and is available to be picked up by a tech writer. When you're ready to take on a new ticket, try to work the queue from the top-down and avoid cherry picking. It's also better to pick up Needs Peer Edit tickets before committing to a new ticket. Something that needs a peer edit is close to done, and helping things across the finish line helps get value into users hands, and frees us up to think about new problems. In Progress This step is for all of the work to be done by the assignee: Research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, writing, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Tickets are moved to this step once work is started by the TW, and remain here until the work is either complete, ready for peer review, or it becomes blocked. If additional large edits are needed after the peer review, the ticket can be moved back to In Progress for those edits. Needs Peer Editor Work that is ready for a peer edit. Once a peer editor picks it up, they move it into In Peer Edit. In Peer Edit This step is for a peer editor to review docs before they go live. Follow the Peer editor workflow, then move the ticket into Peer Edit Done.  Peer Edit Done This step is a holding state once peer editing is complete. After completing their peer edit and delivering their feedback, the peer editor moves the ticket into Peer Edit Done. From there, the assignee on the ticket (not the peer editor) moves the ticket into the appropriate column (In Progress, Blocked, or Closed). Minor edits can be completed from this column but for major doc rework, the ticket should be moved back into the In Progress column. Blocked This step is for tickets that cannot be moved forward by the team. This could be because we're waiting for a response from a SME, or for a feature to deploy, or for final signoff. The team keeps an eye on this column for tickets that may need escalation. Putting something in Blocked rather than In Progress lets us see the status of every ticket at a glance. This column can also be used for extended time out of the office for the assigned writer, if it's work that can be safely held. (If the work cannot be held while you're out, find another writer to step in and take over.) Once you're un-blocked, move the ticket to the appropriate column. If the ticket remains blocked at the end of the current sprint, it will need to be re-reviewed during backlog grooming to determine if the ticket will carry-over into the upcoming sprint, or return to the backlog until a future sprint. Done This step is for work that is 100% finished. Work gets cleared out this column before we start a new sprint. Incomplete (\"carry-over\") tickets Ticket don't carry over automatically between sprints. Instead, any ticket that gets carried over is treated as a \"new\" ticket in the next sprint planning. Before sprint planning, review any open tickets in the board that are assigned to you and figure out what to do with them. For each open ticket assigned to you (or \"carry over\"), decide if you should: Recommended: Clone the ticket and close the old one. This is the best option for partially completed work because it makes metrics easier. If you do: Clone the ticket. Note why we closed the ticket. Add an estimate of points completed in the Points Completed field. Create a follow-up ticket if necessary. Move the ticket to the next sprint. If you do: Review the ticket's action items and description to make sure they're still current. Clear out the ticket points. Move the ticket back to the backlog. If you do: Update the action items and description to make sure they're still current. Note why we moved to the backlog rather than carry over. ← Planning poker Liaisonships → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

Once you select your workload, your inbox should populate with error groups. one.newrelic.com > More > Errors inbox Monitor errors Once you've set up your errors inbox, you can begin proactively monitoring all errors in your stack: Error groups Error groups are sets of events that make up a unique error. Error groups are stored long term and contain metrics, activity log, discussions, and basic information about the unique error. Error groups are tied to the entity, so making a change to the state of an error group in one errors inbox will impact all other inboxes that contain that entity. How error groups work Error events get grouped into an error group when they share the same fingerprint. As events are ingested by New Relic, we run the events through a set of managed rules that output a fingerprint. Every unique fingerprint has a single error group associated with it. The New Relic managed rules normalize the error data, identifying and ignoring unique values such as UUIDs, hex values, email addresses, etc. that would cause grouping “like” errors into unique groups. NR account ID, entity ID, error class, error message, stack trace and exception are all data that can impact a fingerprint. Troubleshooting: similar looking events do not group together If you see “like” error events grouped into different error groups incorrectly, try removing the unique identifier from the error class or message and store those as attributes instead. This will allow you to more easily facet on the attribute values and reduce the number of error groups. If you have a single application reporting as multiple entities in New Relic (i.e. running in different clusters, cells, etc), you might see duplicate error groups, since our grouping logic looks at account and entity IDs as part of the fingerprinting process. You can consider rolling up the multiple entities into a single entity and including only that rolled up entity as part of your errors inbox. You can also use the feedback tool in NR1 to share error groups that could use improved grouping. We’re continually updating our rules to improve the quality of error groups. Occurrences Your errors inbox displays the total number of occurrences of each error group within the selected timeframe. The corresponding sparkline chart displays the total number of occurrences per day over the selected timeframe as you hover over it. Sort By Filter Using the dropdown in the top right, you can sort the list of grouped errors by the number of occurrences or by the error that was last seen (latest first). Triage errors Errors status Errors inbox enables you to triage error groups directly from the main screen or from the error details page. Triaging helps remove the noise from your errors inbox, and lets you focus on the high impact errors that need attention. You can set one of three statuses, and filter your inbox by status. Unresolved: This is the default status of error groups. Resolved: Setting an error as resolved will hide it from the default inbox view unless filters are updated to include resolved errors. If events matching the error group fingerprint occur after marking an error group as resolved, it will automatically reset the status to Unresolved. This can be useful for identifying regressions. Ignored: Ignored will hide the error group from the inbox view unless filters are updated to include ignored errors, or until you stop ignoring the error group. Error details Clicking on a specific error group takes you to the error details page, where you will find full context of the issue. This context can assist in triaging the error and assigning it to the correct team or individual. Occurrences The Occurrences tab includes details like: Related account Stack trace Logs in context Error attributes Number and frequency of occurrences The detailed view also allows you to view specific errors. In the top right, you can navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, and any instance in-between. Attributes The Attributes tab enables you to quickly find commonalities between the related errors for faster resolution. Click on a specific attribute to open a sidebar with specific details. Activity The Activity tab displays a log of the status changes and user assignments of an error group. Discussions The Discussions tab provides room for detailed and organized collaboration. This is key to looping in collaborators and ensuring the entire team has the same context regardless of where they sit. Discussions includes: Threaded conversations: Reply directly to top level comments to tie replies to specific posts. Comment deletion: Delete comments. The content of the post will be removed unless it is the parent of a thread, in which case the box will remain with the message “Comment deleted by user.” Markdown support: Add styling and links to your comments in Markdown. Assign errors You can assign an error group to anyone. Simply select the user from the assign dropdown menu. You may also assign an error to any email address, even if they aren’t a New Relic user. You can update the filter in errors inbox to show only errors assigned to yourself, or a teammate. Important Currently assigning an error group to a user does not send a notification. Notifications of assignment and changes to error groups will be coming soon. Connect an inbox to Slack When connected to Slack, new and resurfaced error groups will be sent to a Slack channel within seconds of them occurring. This enables your team to quickly identify any new errors or regressions, and resolve them quickly with direct links to the stack trace. This short video shows how it works (1:24 minutes): To connect an inbox to Slack: If your Slack workspace does not have the New Relic app installed, do that first. From an inbox, select the Inbox Settings icon (looks like a gear) in the top right corner. Toggle the Slack button to on if it is off. If no workspaces are available, click the plus button to enable Slack with a one click Slack authentication. Once authenticated, you will be able to select a Workspace and specific Channel to send notifications to. Click Test to ensure messages are being sent to the right channel. Connect errors inbox to CodeStream To use CodeStream's Open in IDE integration with your APM stack trace errors, use environment variables to configure your APM agent with your application's commit sha and/or your release tag associated with the running version of your software. Once set up, you can jump from an error group directly to the offending code in your IDE by clicking the Open in IDE button. Learn more here. Connect an inbox to Jira Connect errors inbox to Jira to easily create tickets for your errors, allowing for faster collaboration and resolution. Jira templates allow you to quickly create a ticket containing error details and links directly to the stack trace and APM for quick access and resolution. We store a link to the the ticket alongside the associated error group for a period of time. If the error occurs again within that period, you can easily access associated tickets. Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. To connect an inbox to Jira: Click on the Jira integration icon on the far right side of the error group you want to connect to Jira. Clicking the Jira integration icon allows you to create a ticket based on a template, or create a template if you don't already have one. If you don’t already have a connection to Jira set up in your account, click Add JIRA Workspace from the dropdown. Fill in all the fields and click Test connection before saving to ensure that your details are correct. Next, set up a template. Templates determine what information will be sent to Jira. Find more information about specific fields here. Errors inbox does not currently support two-way communication with Jira, but you can select this option in case it is supported in the future. Once you have a template, click Send test notification to preview what the ticket looks like in Jira. If the preview looks good, click Update message to save the template. Note that a test notification will create a Jira ticket in your Jira workspace. Now your team can create Jira tickets by clicking the Jira integration icon on the far right side of the error group and selecting a template. Jira settings are associated with the account that owns the error group or entity. If you are using the cross-account errors inbox, you will need to set up a Jira connection multiple times.",

      "body": "\"Hero\" is a common term across New Relic for a dedicated, interruptible person who acts as an interface for a team. When you're a docs hero, you're the face of the team. We have two heroes at any given time: the GitHub hero (for issues and pull requests) and the Slack hero (for questions through Slack). We also have a second-shift hero to support EMEA Relics. Every hero's job is to keep things moving for Relics and users. We change GitHub and heroes once a day (we used to do weekly shifts, but we've found daily shifts reduce hero burnout). Goals for heroing A Relic once described the New Relic culture this way: In the end, everyone here is working toward the same purpose [...] That person pinging you with some random request that seems unrelated to your world has the same goals as you. Help them, be kind, be patient. Your mission as hero is to personify that attitude in Docs-land. Here's what that looks like in practice: Create a consistent interface for the team. Having a dedicated hero means the answer to how to get help is always the same: \"Ping the hero!\" Because we've made this our mantra for 7 years, we don't have to re-educate the org on how to get help or who to go to with docs questions. Even as new people join the team, our processes evolve, and our entire publication toolchain has changed, our interaction model remains consistent. Directing questions to the hero avoids having a single point of failure: Even if a liaison is on leave, on the beach, or has moved onto another project, the hero is there to help. Provide a great (internal and external) customer experience. The heroes respond quickly to questions, give timely draft reviews, and perform great customer service and problem solving. Build and share knowledge about the site and our products. The heroes end up touching all kinds of obscure areas of our site and interacting with teams they may never have worked with directly. It's a great opportunity to learn more about New Relic and to build relationships across the org. Edit new content to our standards. We depend on self-service to cover lots of products with relatively few writers. The GitHub hero gives us a single accountable person who can review new content against Tech Docs team standards and turn it around quickly. Buffer the team from interrupts. Since the heroes are our \"designated interruptibles\" for their shifts, the rest of the team is freed up for deeper focus time. When it is appropriate to bring in another team member, heroes can help in streamlining the handoff and providing helpful context so that their teammate can get started quickly with the lowest possible context-switching burden. Heroing is a full-time job As the hero, you're often pulled in a lot of directions in a given shift. Because of this, the expectation is that you do not take on sprint work during your hero shift, unless you really have nothing else to do after completing your hero duties. You're also not expected to know everything as a hero! If something comes up for which you have no easy answer, let the requestor know you're on it and then ping your fellow writers or other SMEs and helpers from across New Relic for help. GitHub hero responsibilities The GitHub hero monitors the GitHub board and the flow of work through GitHub. Triage issues and PRs The GitHub hero triages every incoming pull request and issue. You'll tag the issue and pull request, route it to the correct column or team, and also help review incoming edits. For details on handling all of this, see Managing the GitHub boards. Review PRs The bulk of your time is generally spent reviewing and approving PRs from non-writers. To review an incoming PR: Label the pull request appropriately (see Managing the GitHub boards for details). Assign yourself to the pull request, so it's clear that you're on point to review and merge. Review the pull request, depending on what type of edit it is: If it's a simple \"cosmetic\" edit, review the pull request to ensure it's formatted correctly, technically accurate, and fits New Relic style guidelines. If it's a deeper edit, or a completely new doc, give it an in-depth review. The Docs site edit checklist is a great resource here. If it's a really complex or large edit, consider creating a Jira ticket for an upcoming sprint to give it the review time it needs. If it's a What's new post, pay special attention to frontmatter, links, and image formatting. This content follows marketing style, so it doesn't need to fully match our style guidelines for things like capitalization. If it's a release note, focus your review on formatting and basic style, and ensuring the release note itself is helpful. Release notes don't need to follow all docs style guidelines religiously. Preview your change in Gatsby Cloud or locally. Merge the pull request into develop. Merge develop into main We merge the develop branch into the main branch a few times a day. This kicks off a build, and ultimately is how draft docs become published docs. Currently we do this three times a day: Around 9 am PST, noon PST, and 3 pm PST. To merge, just click this magic link and follow the prompts. Provide peer reviews if time allows During super busy shifts, you likely won't have time for many of these, but if you're having a slow shift please take some time to periodically check the Writer Needs Peer Edit swim lane for fresh peer edit asks from your teammates before you switch over to doing sprint work. Slack hero responsibilities The Slack hero monitors Slack and helps answer questions about docs and route people to the right resource on the team. Update the Slack alias Update the alias to ping your name at the start of your hero shift. To update the alias, type the following into the chat box: !hero set @YOUR_SLACK_HANDLE. For example, if it's Austin's hero shift, the thing to type would be !hero set @austin. Field questions in the #documentation channel Common questions and requests include: Questions about docs content. Answer the question if you know it, or reach out to other writers if it's an area you're not familiar with. Encourage the requestor to edit the docs or submit an issue wherever possible. Triage requests for docs support. If it's a project that already has a liaison attached, connect the requestor to the appropriate writer. If it's a project without exisitng writing support, connect them to a tech docs team manager to have a scoping conversation. Questions about status of a pull request or issue. Check in and see if you can figure out, or pull in the assignee for that pull reuqest if the status isn't clear. Questions about things we don't own (blog, API Explorer, newrelic.com, etc). Help them out by directing them to the appropriate Slack channel. (For a list of properties and their owner, see Who owns the other wesbites? in Google Docs.) If you can't figure out who owns it, try asking the writing team in Slack. Second-shift hero support Our tech writers in Barcelona cover the 2nd shift heroing during their regular working hours. Unlike the US-based heroes, our Barcelona writers hero for an entire two-week sprint. Second-shift heroes cover both GitHub and Slack, but we don't expect that second-shift heroes will field every single request that comes in during their working hours since they're also carrying standard sprint duties during their hero shift. ← Liaisonships Managing the GitHub boards → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "Our team uses an agile Sprint workflow in Jira and GitHub to manage our work. We've further divided our team into squads to simplify planning and improve accountability. All those words are pretty inconsistent in their usage, so let's break them down further. Agile People use agile to mean everything from a specific system of work (which we call sprints), to just \"moving fast, preferably in a way that lets me bend things to my whims.\" Luckily, we don't need to define it from scratch. Wikipedia does an admirable job defining it: Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, empirical knowledge, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. For our team, that means our process is optimized to ship early and often. This lets us respond swiftly to changes in the product roadmap. More importantly, it ensures we validate our solutions with stakeholders, and that we're not letting valuable work sit around and get moldy when it could be out in the world making our users' lives better. Sprint (or scrum) This is the particular flavor of agile we follow. The sprint system (often referred to as scrum) is one major approach to Agile, along with other Agile systems such as Kanban. Sprint systems are often accompanied by a lot of jargon and best practices, but for our team the most essential elements are: Working in strict timeboxes (two weeks in our case) Planning that sprint in advance, and not changing the scope of the sprint (much) once it starts Expecting all team members to contribute to making the sprint a success The video Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell (18 minutes) is an excellent resource for learning about sprint methodology. The Kindle book Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction is also a great read that you can get through in a short afternoon. For more on the \"why\" of Sprint as our chosen methodology, see Key agile principles. And for more on the \"how,\" see Sprint workflow. Jira and GitHub issues Jira and GitHub issues are the tools we use to manage our Agile workflow. If you remember one thing about them, it should be this: using Jira or GitHub issues is not the same as having an agile workflow. They're powerful tools for tracking work and managing a backlog, but the most important part of project management is the structure we impose on that tool. Jira is for sprint work. Sprints are where roadmap docs get written, monthly commits get delivered, and deeper research percolates. We have a backlog, board, and future sprint list in Jira that help us track what people want, what's coming up, and what we're working on now. For more on the mechanics of how we use Jira, see Sprint workflow and Jira boards and Ticket best practices. We use GitHub projects for hero work, customer-reported issues, and managing the flow of PRs and edits. The Docs PRs and Issues board contains everything we're actively working on in GitHub. We'll often connect work in GitHub back to Jira by putting a Jira issue key in the PR or issue title (DOC-1234, for example). For more on the mechanics of how we use GitHub, see Managing the GitHub boards. Teams and squads Our team is the Tech Docs team. We're collectively responsible for docs.newrelic.com and sundry writing content. Our team is further divided into two agile squads (The Odd Squad and The Amp Squad), one squad for each manager. The primary function of squads is to simplify sprint planning, backlog grooming, and liaisonships. Less people means shorter meetings. It also means better information sharing: The more people you have in a group, the more lines of communication are needed (see illustration) to maintain a shared understanding. Small squads can collaborate more easily than a large team, because not everyone needs to keep in mind everything that goes on everywhere. Each squad is responsible for its own grooming and sprint planning, but the managers and scrum masters coordinate grooming to ensure we're meeting our overall goals as a team.

      "body": "Jira, a project management tool made by Atlassian, is how we manage our projects and understand the work we are doing and have done. Jira tickets may seem at first to be simple to-do lists that we use to know what things to do for a project. But they are much more important than that. Tip For Relics: Use the docs.newrelic.com/jira template when you create a ticket! It'll automatically pre-fill your ticket with a template that helps create a good ticket. Why do we use Jira? We create tickets to record work-to-be done for a project, scope new work, share information for any writer to complete a story, forecast our output and to estimate project timelines, and have a record of work done. In other words, Jira has a role at every point in a project: Before a project Scoping, syncing on expectations, giving tech writer instructions During a project Keeps team and management posted about project; allows for hand-offs and swarming After a project Understand what work we did, and helps researching on future projects What work needs a ticket? There aren't hard-and-fast rules about what work needs a Jira ticket and what doesn't. A good shorthand is that any project that takes more than a couple hours is a good candidate for a ticket. However, the goal of creating tickets is not to track writer time in detail. So many kinds of work (meetings, ongoing minor liaison tasks, hero work) generally do not need to go into Jira. Keeping tickets up-to-date In general, you should write your tickets as though you might win the lottery tomorrow (a principle known as lottery factor or bus factor). In practice, someone should be able to read your ticket and figure out within about ten minutes what the status is and what the next step is. This makes it easy for us to take vacations, pass work off to another docs writer if needed, and escalate blockers. These things help with lottery factor: Update the Action Item list as you complete tasks and add or remove scope. When you move a ticket to Blocked, include a note explaining the change in status. When you close a ticket, give a summary of the work done and any relevant thoughts you have on the work and potential related issues. Update the Timeline, People, and Resources sections as the project evolves. Add important conversations (emails or Slack convos from SMEs) that give important context for the work done. (Note: It's a good idea to ask permission before doing this, because some people might not like their informal words placed in a public place.) Add Jira context to PRs and commits When you edit the site, include the Jira issue key (DOC-1234, for example) in your pull request title and/or commit summary. That makes it easier for other writers to connect the dots later if we're trying to figure out why something changed or who knows about a particular subject. Checklist for writing a good ticket Helpful title A ticket name should be easy to find via search, understand the work at a glance, mention the product or feature, and describe the goal or issue. Examples of good ticket titles: Browser API: Update custom attribute-related docs or Distributed tracing: Add more detail about CAT relationship. Action items An action item list describing the work to be done What docs are affected Links to pull requests, Google Docs drafts, etc. How substantial the writing work is in each doc How the resulting work should be structured Whether or not a peer edit is needed Anyone who should be notified when a doc is published Proper sizing Story is scoped to the smallest reasonable size Can be completed within a 2 week sprint Delivers incremental value Dates Publication date or due date Dates for other key events (betas, limited releases, etc.) Resources and people People, including last names and roles List of related or affected docs Other internal and external resources Related issues Labels and fields Jira tickets: Component, Product Group, and Priority GitHub issues: from_, pg_, and content labels ← Managing the GitHub boards Appendix: Project scoping cheatsheet → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "As tech doc writers (TW) we edit docs, do peer edits, or use the Docs Team GitHub board to track the status of issues and pull requests (PR). Who is who in an issue/PR? GitHub keeps track of all activity concerning an issue or PR, including, of course, the people involved. When a new issue or PR is filed, check on the filer’s username and see if they're listed as a member of the New Relic organization. If they aren't, try to find them on Slack based on their username. If you're not sure about someone's affiliation, treat them as external until you know otherwise. People in an issue/PR include: Creator: The person who opened the issue or PR. This could be a writer, a Relic, or an external user. We'll label the issue or PR differently depending on who created it. If you're not sure if a user is a Relic, a good trick is to click on their profile and see if they're a member of the New Relic GitHub org. Assignee: The person taking responsibility for a PR or issue. This will usually be used by the Hero or Sidekick to assign non-TW PRs and issues to themselves. It can also be used to take a TW’s PR or issue over from them. Reviewer: The person who reviews or peer edits the code/document and approves the changes. Not necessarily the person responsible for that area or responsible for merging the commit. You can pre-assign up to 100 reviewers to a given issue. Track issues in the board The docs board has the following columns: Column Description Needs triage The Hero or Sidekick review and label issues and PRs in this column, then drag them to the appropriate column. If a PR or issue is labeled eng, the Hero/Sidekick can go ahead and click its ellipses icon to archive it. Hero: to do PRs that the Hero needs to review, publish, and follow up with SMEs as needed. Hero: Assign yourself as Assignee. In review (Hero or any TW) Drag PRs to this column when they are being reviewed. This shows who is reviewing and what is being reviewed, so two writers don’t mistakenly work on the same PR. Any TW: Writer needs PR review PRs from Tech Docs team members that need a light edit pass to make sure everything in GitHub is correct. This should be checked by other writers every few hours so PRs don’t get stale. If you have a PR that’s been lingering here too long, ask for a reviewer in #doc_sprint_talk. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Any TW: needs peer edit Like our Needs Peer Edit column in Jira: A writer has requested a review of their PR. Review their PR in GitHub and leave comments. Whoever takes it: assign yourself as Reviewer. Waiting on SME/Blocked For PRs that are blocked by need for SME info or confirmation (for example, as Hero you are waiting on an answer from the person who sent in a Hero pull request). Waiting on TW to merge All reviews are complete. The TW who created the PR (or who is assigned the issue) needs to merge this work into develop. Drafts A draft is a way to open a PR while indicating that the work is still in progress and not necessarily ready to merge immediately. You can't merge a Draft PR directly. Instead, you must move it out of draft status first. When you see a draft PR (especially from outside the team!), treat it as though it's a working draft, and reach out to the creator to discuss. Read more on GitHub's drafts. As a Hero, make sure you attend to the following throughout your day: Check in with the previous Hero at the start of your day (especially on Monday at the start of the week). Don’t forget to sync with the BCN Hero if necessary. Watch for incoming PRs in #docs_deploys, and review everything in the Needs triage column. Drag cards from that column to the appropriate column. Work through the cards in the Hero: to do column. Everyone on the team helps keep things moving: All writers should keep an eye on both Any TW columns. There's one column for PRs that need a simpler review before merging (typo fixes, drive-by edits, etc), and another column for PRs that need a peer edit. There are also two blocked columns: One for PRs blocked on a SME, and another column where we're waiting on the TW who created the PR to review feedback and/or merge. After merging, remove your ticket from the board. Deal with references in GitHub (and the style guide) Don't link to anything non-public from a public place. You can reference Jira tickets, but reference tickets by issue key (DOC-1234 is ok) rather than a link (https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-1234 is not). Don't mention traffic or usage numbers publicly. Don't reference internal people by name. If they have a GH account, @mention their GH handle. If they don't, talk instead about teams (\"talk to a browser team engineer\" or \"Support Engineer\") rather than people. You can mention the #documentation channel and hero. Merge releases into main work (or, when do we publish?) The Hero currently merges three times a day: At 9 AM (morning), 12 PM (noon), and 3 PM (evening) Pacific. We merge release branches into main to avoid interuptions when someone merges into develop during a release. To learn more about this workflow, see the gitflow documentation in Atlassian. To start a release: Create a branch based off develop Github Desktop by clicking Current Branch in the top header, clicking New Branch in the dropdown, and then selecting Develop. Name the branch following this pattern: daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning/noon/evening. Here's an example: daily-release/10-27-21-morning. Push your changes by clicking Push Origin in GitHub Desktop. Create a pull request into main from your new daily release branch by clicking Create Pull Request. This will open a pull request screen on github.com. Pull requests default to merging into develop, so select main as the base branch in the left side of the page and then click Submit Pull Request. Wait until all the checks complete, and then merge the pull request. All branches that follow the daily-release/mm-dd-yy-morning pattern are protected branches. This means the branches can't be deleted or pushed to by non-admins. GitHub labels Every issue needs labels to help us triage and track the health of our backlog: content: Always add, this indicates the issue is content-related rather than a design or engineering issue. pg_*: Always add to indicate the product group. For full definitions, see the \"Doc Jira and GitHub fields\" doc in the internal team Google Drive. Indicate who created the issue: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). Optionally: docs-issues-migrate: Issues that are too large in scope for the docs team to handle without product team expertise. This label alerts the docs issues team to migrate these issues into the customer feedback channel where they will be triaged and sent to product teams. Jira’d: Issues that have a corresponding Jira ticket. Make sure you leave the Jira number in the comments of the issue (for example, DOC-1234). Every pull request needs these labels so we can see where our contributions come from: content: Always add, this indicates the PR is content-related rather than design or engineering. Indicate who created the pull request: from_internal: A Relic created it. from_external: A user opened it in the repo OR it came in through #customer-feedback process. from_tw: One of us created it (unless we were passing along #customer-feedback). If the PR fixes an external issue, label it as from_tw since the work was done by a tech writer.",

      "body": "Landing pages are a specialized type of page that serve as the starting pages for various New Relic products. For example, you'll see landing pages for Application monitoring (APM) and Browser monitoring. Important This landing page information does not apply to the docs home page. If you need to create a new landing page, you can either copy an existing landing page, or you can modify the sample landing page shown at the bottom. The next sections look at what you need to include for each landing page. Front matter When you insert the front matter, be sure to designate the type as landingPage. Here's an example: --- title: APM type: landingPage --- Copy Tip In the front matter, the following are optional: tags, translate, and redirects. So, you can leave them out if they don't have any values. Introduction section Following the front matter, the first content section is a two-column introduction (also called the hero section). This includes the following: A <LandingPageHero> component wrapping all the introductory content. A <HeroContent> component wrapping the text portion of the introduction (the content in the left column). An image or video (appears in the right column). A caption (optional), which is wrapped by the <figcaption> component. Here's an example of the hero section that shows you where to insert your content: <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> Copy Tiles Tiles are a series of boxes after the introduction. They contain the main subject areas for your product. You should just list these in order you want them to appear, and the cascading style sheet will render them across the page. Here's an example of a tile: <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE.\" href=\"/docs/INSERT_THE_DIRECTORY_PATH_TO_THE_TARGET_LANDING_PAGE_INDEX.HTML\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_THE_ICON_NAME\" > INSERT_TILE_CONTENT_HERE... </LandingPageTile> ... Copy For each tile, do the following: Insert a value for title that explains the purpose of the category. Insert a value for href that links to the target landing page. If the target landing page is index.html, you can just include the directory path with no filename since index.html is the default (it doesn't cause any problems if you include index.html). Insert a value for icon by prefixing the icon name with fe- (Feather icons), logo- (third-party logos), or nr- (New Relic logos). For example, here is the format for a feather icon: fe-alert-triangle). Tip For more details about icons, see Embed images. Between the LandingPageTile tags, insert text, such as a bullet list with links to product documentation. Button for viewing all docs in the category After your tiles, you should have a single button that offers to take users to all the documentation for that category. The table of contents page that gets linked here is always at the same path as the landing page, but with /table-of-contents appended to it. These table of contents pages get built automatically for every landing page. For example, if this landing page was located at /docs/apm, this link should be /docs/apm/table-of-contents. Here's an example: <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy Code sample Here's a sample landing page you could modify to suit your needs: --- title: INSERT_YOUR_TITLE_HERE type: landingPage --- <LandingPageHero> <HeroContent> INSERT_PARAGRAPHS_FOR_YOUR_INTRODUCTION </HeroContent> ![INSERT_ALT-TEXT_HERE](./images/INSERT_IMAGE_FILE_NAME.png \"INSERT_THE_IMAGE_TITLE_HERE\") <figcaption> INSERT_OPTIONAL_CAPTION_USING_SAME_INDENTATION_AS_IMAGE </figcaption> </LandingPageHero> <LandingPageTileGrid> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Aliquam auctor mattis nisl ut iaculis. * [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Suspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod, a consectetur tortor vulputate. </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) to lectus diam, ornare vitae dui suscipit, laoreet ultrices lacus. * Mauris tempor massa ac augue mattis, nec pharetra quam mollis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) rhoncus tortor vitae libero laoreet feugiat. * Donec dui elit, fermentum vel faucibus sed, rhoncus in felis [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) uspendisse pharetra elit sit amet risus euismod. * Pellentesque finibus magna vitae hendrerit gravida [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique. * Etiam imperdiet felis eu ipsum consequat tristique [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> <LandingPageTile title=\"INSERT_YOUR_BOX_TITLE_HERE\" icon=\"fe-INSERT_ICON_NAME_HERE\" > * Use [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL) Quisque hendrerit, dolor sed sodales aliquet. * Vestibulum varius lectus ac velit euismod [INSERT_LINK_NAME](INSERT_LINK_URL). </LandingPageTile> </LandingPageTileGrid> <ButtonLink role=\"button\" to=\"INSERT_LINK_TO_DIRECTORY_WITH_ALL_THESE_DOCS/table-of-contents\" variant=\"normal\" > View all INSERT_YOUR_CATEGORY_HERE docs </ButtonLink> Copy",

      "body": "Our team uses a fairly \"by the book\" agile-scrum implementation, with the understanding that we can tweak the workflow as needed to work better for our flow. This handbook doesn't describe every aspect of how a sprint system should work, but focuses on the specific choices our team made as we evolved our agile process. As we evolve the system, it's helpful to know what our goals are. That can help illuminate whether a problem with the system is worth solving, and how to solve it without compromising on the essential things that make the team run smoothly. Focus on the team's work Our goal is for our team to deliver the most valuable work for the business and our users, every sprint. This description from Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction nails what that means in practice: The role of each and every team member is to help the team deliver potentially shippable product in each sprint. Often, the best way to do this is by contributing work in their area of specialty. Other times, however, the team will need them to work outside of their area of specialty in order to best move backlog items from \"in progress\" to \"done.\" What we are describing is a mindset change from \"doing my job\" to \"doing the job.\" We aim to complete 100% of our work every sprint. In practice this is rarely attainable: We know that dates will move, scopes will expand, or our estimates will be wrong. But we've found that this 100% benchmark ensures we prioritize our shared team goal (the sprint), rather than our individual deliverables. Maximize swarming We want writers to build expertise, but we don't want to isolate ourselves. An alerts team at New Relic summed it up nicely: Our philosophy is, \"The team is the unit of work.\" This means that teams contribute to projects, teams solve problems, etc. We don't assign projects to individuals, and no one should ever be a single point of failure in the organization. If your team struggles to function effectively without you, your flexibility to take time off will be very limited. In such a case, we need to improve the skills and overall health of your team, ensure the team is setup for success, and ensure we have an appropriate team structure and charter in place. And an ops team demonstrates the most important practical implication: Our intention for tickets is that anyone should be able to select a task and have the information needed to understand and start on the work. Sometimes, this means we work a little slower in order to learn or teach something---and that's okay! Ultimately, working this way makes our team more resilient and makes it easier for New Relic to get consistent, high-quality docs. The Ticket best practices doc describes in detail the rules and best practices we've discovered help us achieve this. Enforce our points budgets Our team votes on all stories brought into a sprint, and we cap the number of stories based on our points budget. We generally vote as though the least-experienced person on the team will take the ticket. Having a strict points budget allows us to protect the team from overwork, predict our velocity over time, and ensure we actually have enough time to finish our work. Work incrementally Our goal is to deliver value as often as possible. Work that sits in a draft state for a long time can easily become wasted work: SMEs can become unavailable, priorities can change, and our knowledge can become stale. In practice, this means we work in fairly short two week sprints, publish early and often, and plan our projects so we can easily deliver 70% and then pivot to different priorities if something more important comes along. Encourage self-service edits Anyone can edit our open-sourced docs. With hundreds of Relics and users editing the docs each year, we can spend more of our writing time on high-impact work rather than simple maintenance edits. In order to reward teams that help us work this way, we prioritize this work in our queue. For work the writers need to do themselves, we ask for at least one full sprint of lead time. If someone comes to us the Tuesday after a sprint starts, that means they could be waiting up to two weeks for us to kick off work! But if someone edits the docs themselves, we promise to get their edit live within a 1 to 3 business day SLA. This lets us create win-wins: Rather than a simple \"no,\" a requestor can decide whether they truly need that content out now (in which case they can create that first draft) or whether they're okay waiting a week or two. ← Agile vs sprints: A profusion of terms Agile roles → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

The new sprint starts on a Tuesday with sprint planning, where we commit to a set of stories that we're confident we can complete by the end of the sprint. Near the end of the sprint, we prepare for the next sprint with backlog grooming. The sprint closes with a retro where we discuss what went right and what went wrong, and then we kick off a new cycle. Each squad does their own backlog grooming and sprint planning, and manages their sprint backlog independently. We do retros together so we can talk through issues that affect both squads and share expertise and ideas. Tip Why do we end sprints on Mondays and start Tuesdays? This funny schedule makes things easier to work across timezones. If we ended sprints on Fridays, our Barcelona-based writers would need to do retros and grooming on Friday evening, and who wants that? Sprint planning On the first Tuesday of a new sprint, we commit to a series of stories until we have filled our capacity for the sprint. This is the largest meeting in the sprint---about 60 to 90 minutes. Before the sprint planning meeting, the scrum master for each squad calculates their point budget. Then, during the meeting: We select the highest priority item in the backlog. The person who nominated the story introduces it, and the team asks questions until everyone feels ready to vote. The team plays planning poker. Everyone secretly chooses a card, then we reveal them at the same time: If everyone picks the same card, that's the point value and we move on. If there's an even split between two cards, we choose the larger and move on. If it's mixed, the highest and lowest voters briefly explain their votes. Then we vote again. Once we're sure we can fit the story in, we subtract its story points from the sprint's points budget. We repeat the above steps until we've used up our points budget. We generally avoid pre-assigning people to stories during sprint planning. Instead, we pick up the next story or peer edit in the To Do column as stories are completed. Backlog grooming The day before the sprint starts, we do two rounds of backlog grooming. The purpose of backlog grooming is to prioritize work for sprint planning, and identify stories that need to be fixed before sprint planning to ensure scope is clear and planning runs smoothly. The first round of backlog grooming is by squad, where the members and manager of the squad get together and work through the grooming checklist. Then we do a second round of grooming with the managers and scrum masters to look at the sprint backlog for both squads and ensure nothing is or has fallen through the cracks. In the grooming, we: Each writer brings their personal \"top five\" tickets. The manager works with writers to prioritize those into a single, stack-ranked list for the team. We talk through stories and ensure they look ready for sprint planning (essentially, do they fit the Checklist for story readiness?). After grooming, the scrum master sends out a list of \"homework\" for stories that need improving. Retro Every other sprint, we conduct a 60 minute retrospective meeting, where we discuss: How do we feel about the sprint? What went well? Where can we improve? Anything we should start or stop doing? The goal of the retro is to improve the way we work together. That could be related to the sprint process, to how we collaborate with SMEs, to peer edits, and so on. ← Agile roles Planning poker → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full platform user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full platform users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full platform user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple users. To control how basic users upgrade to become full platform users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full platform users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full platform user count If you're on New Relic One pricing model, your count of full platform users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full platform users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full platform users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full platform user This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. The user type (basic user or full platform user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing model, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to our more curated observability UI experiences (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full platform users or request upgrade access from admins. Full platform user (also called full user). Details: Full platform users have access to everything (dependent on role restrictions), which includes our curated observability UI experiences, such as APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full platform user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full platform user in another, the user is considered a full platform user and has full platform user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role. Bulk user management With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Bulk user management troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Our team uses a fairly \"by the book\" agile-scrum implementation, with the understanding that we can tweak the workflow as needed to work better for our flow. This handbook doesn't describe every aspect of how a sprint system should work, but focuses on the specific choices our team made as we evolved our agile process. As we evolve the system, it's helpful to know what our goals are. That can help illuminate whether a problem with the system is worth solving, and how to solve it without compromising on the essential things that make the team run smoothly. Focus on the team's work Our goal is for our team to deliver the most valuable work for the business and our users, every sprint. This description from Scrum: A Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction nails what that means in practice: The role of each and every team member is to help the team deliver potentially shippable product in each sprint. Often, the best way to do this is by contributing work in their area of specialty. Other times, however, the team will need them to work outside of their area of specialty in order to best move backlog items from \"in progress\" to \"done.\" What we are describing is a mindset change from \"doing my job\" to \"doing the job.\" We aim to complete 100% of our work every sprint. In practice this is rarely attainable: We know that dates will move, scopes will expand, or our estimates will be wrong. But we've found that this 100% benchmark ensures we prioritize our shared team goal (the sprint), rather than our individual deliverables. Maximize swarming We want writers to build expertise, but we don't want to isolate ourselves. An alerts team at New Relic summed it up nicely: Our philosophy is, \"The team is the unit of work.\" This means that teams contribute to projects, teams solve problems, etc. We don't assign projects to individuals, and no one should ever be a single point of failure in the organization. If your team struggles to function effectively without you, your flexibility to take time off will be very limited. In such a case, we need to improve the skills and overall health of your team, ensure the team is setup for success, and ensure we have an appropriate team structure and charter in place. And an ops team demonstrates the most important practical implication: Our intention for tickets is that anyone should be able to select a task and have the information needed to understand and start on the work. Sometimes, this means we work a little slower in order to learn or teach something---and that's okay! Ultimately, working this way makes our team more resilient and makes it easier for New Relic to get consistent, high-quality docs. The Ticket best practices doc describes in detail the rules and best practices we've discovered help us achieve this. Enforce our points budgets Our team votes on all stories brought into a sprint, and we cap the number of stories based on our points budget. We generally vote as though the least-experienced person on the team will take the ticket. Having a strict points budget allows us to protect the team from overwork, predict our velocity over time, and ensure we actually have enough time to finish our work. Work incrementally Our goal is to deliver value as often as possible. Work that sits in a draft state for a long time can easily become wasted work: SMEs can become unavailable, priorities can change, and our knowledge can become stale. In practice, this means we work in fairly short two week sprints, publish early and often, and plan our projects so we can easily deliver 70% and then pivot to different priorities if something more important comes along. Encourage self-service edits Anyone can edit our open-sourced docs. With hundreds of Relics and users editing the docs each year, we can spend more of our writing time on high-impact work rather than simple maintenance edits. In order to reward teams that help us work this way, we prioritize this work in our queue. For work the writers need to do themselves, we ask for at least one full sprint of lead time.

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Desired Outcome Improve customer engagement and retention by measuring and improving performance in a way that better aligns to the end user experience. Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: Availability This KPI measures whether or not your application or its pages can be accessed by your users Goal: Improve uptime and availablity Thresholds: < 99% warning < 95% critical 99% or \"2 9's\" is a good minimum standard of availability, even for employee applications or sub-pages. We configure these default thresholds into the dashboards. You can easily change this to better suit expectations for your application. Largest contentful paint (LCP) Part of Core Web Vitals. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Thresholds: Warning: > 2.5 seconds Critical: > 4.0 seconds LCP thresholds are defined by the team at Google. The thresholds and the supporting logic behind them can be found here. First input delay (FID) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures the interactivity of a page by tracking the time between user interaction (such as clicking a link or entering text) when the browser begins processing the event. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Thresholds: Warning: > 100 milliseconds Critical: > 300 milliseconds FID thresholds are defined by the team at Google. The thresholds and the supporting logic behind them can be found here. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) Part of Core Web Vitals. Measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Thresholds: Warning: > 0.1 score Critical: > 0.25 score CLS thresholds are defined by the team at Google. The thresholds and the supporting logic behind them can be found here. Time to first byte (TTFB) This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Google considers TTFB secondary to Core Web Vitals. We recommend measuring it for a more complete picture. It can be revealing if you see a change in LCP, because it answers the question as to whether the change occurred server side or client side. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Thresholds: Warning > 0.5 seconds Critical > 1.0 seconds According to Google and Search Engine People, 500 milliseconds is a decent TTFB for pages with dynamic content. You can find mention of these recommendations here. Ajax response times Slow ajax calls can make the user feel as though nothing is happening or the page is broken. If the response time is slow enough, users may even abandon the journey. Goal: Measure and improve ajax response times. Thresholds: Warning > 2 seconds Critical > 2.5 seconds These thresholds come from experience with customers across a variety of industries. HTTP error rate HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Thresholds: Warning < 99% of requests are successful Critical < 97% of requests are successful These thresholds come from experience with customers across a variety of industries. We made the assumption that every ajax request is associated with something the user is trying to achieve and treat it accordingly. Because users will often retry failed actions, we allowed for space between warning and critical thresholds. If the ajax requests being measured are an important part of the user journey, we recommended aiming for higher success rates, such as 99.5% or 99.9%. If the ajax requests are tied to login requests, separate 4xx response codes from 5xx response codes and set a much lower threshold for the 4xx responses. You can look to historical response code rates to determine a reasonable threshold. JavaScript error rate This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. Thresholds: Warning: > 5% errors per page view Critical: > 10% errors per page view These thresholds come from experience with customers across a variety of industries. For each KPI, we defined thresholds - one for warning, another for critical. You might ask where these values come from or how you can be sure they should apply to your application. Our thresholds are the ones recommended by Google (as with Core Web Vitals) or by us, based on our experience across a large number of customers and applications. If you feel strongly that they should be different, you can adjust them, but you should do this at the organizational level rather than on an application by application basis. Quality Foundation helps you identify where in your application you need to make improvements that will optimize user retention, conversion and satisfaction. It is less about where things are and more about where to get to. It also shows you what you should be measuring going forward. You can use this to define SLOs (in a service level dashboard) and alert on them. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events greater than or equal to 2x an average sprint Establish current state Review instrumented pages Validate Browser URL grouping Understand how you will segment your data Import the quality foundation dashboard Capture current performance for each dashboard page Review instrumented pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand how you will segment your data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the quality foundation dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture current performance for each dashboard page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Decide which KPIs to improve Improve targeted KPIs Improve page load performance Improve AJAX response times Improve the AJAX error rate Improve JavaScript errors Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve page load performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX response times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX error rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve JavaScript errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices to adopt Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Our team uses an agile Sprint workflow in Jira and GitHub to manage our work. We've further divided our team into squads to simplify planning and improve accountability. All those words are pretty inconsistent in their usage, so let's break them down further. Agile People use agile to mean everything from a specific system of work (which we call sprints), to just \"moving fast, preferably in a way that lets me bend things to my whims.\" Luckily, we don't need to define it from scratch. Wikipedia does an admirable job defining it: Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, empirical knowledge, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. For our team, that means our process is optimized to ship early and often. This lets us respond swiftly to changes in the product roadmap. More importantly, it ensures we validate our solutions with stakeholders, and that we're not letting valuable work sit around and get moldy when it could be out in the world making our users' lives better. Sprint (or scrum) This is the particular flavor of agile we follow. The sprint system (often referred to as scrum) is one major approach to Agile, along with other Agile systems such as Kanban. Sprint systems are often accompanied by a lot of jargon and best practices, but for our team the most essential elements are: Working in strict timeboxes (two weeks in our case) Planning that sprint in advance, and not changing the scope of the sprint (much) once it starts Expecting all team members to contribute to making the sprint a success The video Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell (18 minutes) is an excellent resource for learning about sprint methodology. The Kindle book Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction is also a great read that you can get through in a short afternoon. For more on the \"why\" of Sprint as our chosen methodology, see Key agile principles. And for more on the \"how,\" see Sprint workflow. Jira and GitHub issues Jira and GitHub issues are the tools we use to manage our Agile workflow. If you remember one thing about them, it should be this: using Jira or GitHub issues is not the same as having an agile workflow. They're powerful tools for tracking work and managing a backlog, but the most important part of project management is the structure we impose on that tool. Jira is for sprint work. Sprints are where roadmap docs get written, monthly commits get delivered, and deeper research percolates. We have a backlog, board, and future sprint list in Jira that help us track what people want, what's coming up, and what we're working on now. For more on the mechanics of how we use Jira, see Sprint workflow and Jira boards and Ticket best practices. We use GitHub projects for hero work, customer-reported issues, and managing the flow of PRs and edits. The Docs PRs and Issues board contains everything we're actively working on in GitHub. We'll often connect work in GitHub back to Jira by putting a Jira issue key in the PR or issue title (DOC-1234, for example). For more on the mechanics of how we use GitHub, see Managing the GitHub boards. Teams and squads Our team is the Tech Docs team. We're collectively responsible for docs.newrelic.com and sundry writing content. Our team is further divided into two agile squads (The Odd Squad and The Amp Squad), one squad for each manager. The primary function of squads is to simplify sprint planning, backlog grooming, and liaisonships. Less people means shorter meetings. It also means better information sharing: The more people you have in a group, the more lines of communication are needed (see illustration) to maintain a shared understanding. Small squads can collaborate more easily than a large team, because not everyone needs to keep in mind everything that goes on everywhere.

      "body": "Like most agile teams, we divide up the roles on our team into team members, scrum masters, product owners, and managers. We treat some of those roles differently than a traditional engineer-centric scrum team: We combine the role of team manager and product owner into one person. Each writer is responsible for \"liaisonships\" where they track work across a particular product or feature and bring in appropriate stories. We don't expect scrum masters to clear blockers (that's a manager's job), and scrum mastering is not a full-time job. We divide the team further into two squads, each with its own team members, scrum master, and product owners. Team member Team members are responsible for: Doing writing work. Improving the team's processes and how we work together. Writing stories for sprints in accordance with their work (via laisionships, SME conversations, hero work, etc.). The person who nominates a story will also present it during sprint planning. See Ticket best practices for tips on writing a good ticket. Most team members will be assigned one or more Liaisonships (project assignments). Liaisons are responsible for nominating stories for sprints from other teams. Scrum master Each squad has a scrum master. The scrum master is not responsible for unblocking stories or communicating with stakeholders on behalf of the team (this work belongs to individual writers and their manager). We believe this lets the business have a single point of accountability (managers) for decisions, and ensures scrum masters have hands-on experience of what it's like to be a writer. Instead, for us the scrum master is a custodian of the sprint process and the MC for sprint meetings. In backlog grooming: The scrum master handles the mechanics of talking through each ticket and facilitating conversations about story quality. In sprint planning: The scrum master leads conversation, tracks discussion time, adds point values to stories, and organizes/ranks sprint candidates in real time. They don't present the stories, though—stories should be introduced by the person who nominated the story for the sprint. In retros: The scrum master facilitates the discussion, captures action items, and takes notes. Tech Docs managers (and product owner) Each squad has a manager---or perhaps you could say each manager has a squad. Either way, the manager's role is to prioritize the right work for the business, maintain a healthy workload, and help escalate when a writer needs help. The managers are responsible for understanding how our entire body of work serves the organization, and making informed decisions about our velocity and workload. The manager engages with other teams to know which features may be coming into the pipeline and has a general understanding of work that may be in future sprints. This lets them make final priority decisions for the team and be accountable to the business for those tradeoffs. The manager is also responsible for assigning liaisonships and ensuring we're covering the portfolio. They'll also work with other teams to unblock writers when needed. Key stakeholders Our key internal stakeholders include PMs, engineers, designers, and executives. Writers work with the stakeholders to know when new work is coming, and to communicate documentation needs/timelines.

      "body": "Our team uses an agile Sprint workflow in Jira and GitHub to manage our work. We've further divided our team into squads to simplify planning and improve accountability. All those words are pretty inconsistent in their usage, so let's break them down further. Agile People use agile to mean everything from a specific system of work (which we call sprints), to just \"moving fast, preferably in a way that lets me bend things to my whims.\" Luckily, we don't need to define it from scratch. Wikipedia does an admirable job defining it: Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, empirical knowledge, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. For our team, that means our process is optimized to ship early and often. This lets us respond swiftly to changes in the product roadmap. More importantly, it ensures we validate our solutions with stakeholders, and that we're not letting valuable work sit around and get moldy when it could be out in the world making our users' lives better. Sprint (or scrum) This is the particular flavor of agile we follow. The sprint system (often referred to as scrum) is one major approach to Agile, along with other Agile systems such as Kanban. Sprint systems are often accompanied by a lot of jargon and best practices, but for our team the most essential elements are: Working in strict timeboxes (two weeks in our case) Planning that sprint in advance, and not changing the scope of the sprint (much) once it starts Expecting all team members to contribute to making the sprint a success The video Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell (18 minutes) is an excellent resource for learning about sprint methodology. The Kindle book Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction is also a great read that you can get through in a short afternoon. For more on the \"why\" of Sprint as our chosen methodology, see Key agile principles. And for more on the \"how,\" see Sprint workflow. Jira and GitHub issues Jira and GitHub issues are the tools we use to manage our Agile workflow. If you remember one thing about them, it should be this: using Jira or GitHub issues is not the same as having an agile workflow. They're powerful tools for tracking work and managing a backlog, but the most important part of project management is the structure we impose on that tool. Jira is for sprint work. Sprints are where roadmap docs get written, monthly commits get delivered, and deeper research percolates. We have a backlog, board, and future sprint list in Jira that help us track what people want, what's coming up, and what we're working on now. For more on the mechanics of how we use Jira, see Sprint workflow and Jira boards and Ticket best practices. We use GitHub projects for hero work, customer-reported issues, and managing the flow of PRs and edits. The Docs PRs and Issues board contains everything we're actively working on in GitHub. We'll often connect work in GitHub back to Jira by putting a Jira issue key in the PR or issue title (DOC-1234, for example). For more on the mechanics of how we use GitHub, see Managing the GitHub boards. Teams and squads Our team is the Tech Docs team. We're collectively responsible for docs.newrelic.com and sundry writing content. Our team is further divided into two agile squads (The Odd Squad and The Amp Squad), one squad for each manager. The primary function of squads is to simplify sprint planning, backlog grooming, and liaisonships. Less people means shorter meetings. It also means better information sharing: The more people you have in a group, the more lines of communication are needed (see illustration) to maintain a shared understanding. Small squads can collaborate more easily than a large team, because not everyone needs to keep in mind everything that goes on everywhere. Each squad is responsible for its own grooming and sprint planning, but the managers and scrum masters coordinate grooming to ensure we're meeting our overall goals as a team.

      "body": "All of our sprint work is tracked in Jira. The workflow depends on what type of work we're dealing with: Planned or unplanned (\"surprise!\") work. Planned work Planned work includes all work that is currently in our backlog or has been added to the current sprint as a result of a Sprint Planning session. This could include writing or updating documentation, research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Unplanned work (surprises!) Usually, we get notified of major requests far enough in advance that we can include them in liaison project plans, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. Occasionally, something bigger surprises us that needs emergency support. Follow this process with new docs asks to assess the scope of work and ensure we address valid docs needs within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal is to treat the sprint as sacred and insulate against \"surprise\" work that is not absolutely crucial. But we also want to ensure we're providing good internal customer service, and not getting hung up on process niceties for things that are small. Jira boards: Backlog and future sprints This is where the vast majority of tickets spend their time. Most tickets (even for active projects) spend at least a little time here before moving into a sprint to be actively worked. Being in the backlog doesn't mean something isn't important---just that we haven't committed to it yet.  You can also add tickets straight to a future sprint. This is where tickets tentatively assigned to a future sprint will be found. Tickets can be assigned here to be held for backlog grooming and sprint planning.  Jira boards: Current sprint Proposed This step is for work that has been assigned to the current sprint during Sprint Planning and is available to be picked up by a tech writer. When you're ready to take on a new ticket, try to work the queue from the top-down and avoid cherry picking. It's also better to pick up Needs Peer Edit tickets before committing to a new ticket. Something that needs a peer edit is close to done, and helping things across the finish line helps get value into users hands, and frees us up to think about new problems. In Progress This step is for all of the work to be done by the assignee: Research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, writing, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Tickets are moved to this step once work is started by the TW, and remain here until the work is either complete, ready for peer review, or it becomes blocked. If additional large edits are needed after the peer review, the ticket can be moved back to In Progress for those edits. Needs Peer Editor Work that is ready for a peer edit. Once a peer editor picks it up, they move it into In Peer Edit. In Peer Edit This step is for a peer editor to review docs before they go live. Follow the Peer editor workflow, then move the ticket into Peer Edit Done.  Peer Edit Done This step is a holding state once peer editing is complete. After completing their peer edit and delivering their feedback, the peer editor moves the ticket into Peer Edit Done. From there, the assignee on the ticket (not the peer editor) moves the ticket into the appropriate column (In Progress, Blocked, or Closed). Minor edits can be completed from this column but for major doc rework, the ticket should be moved back into the In Progress column. Blocked This step is for tickets that cannot be moved forward by the team. This could be because we're waiting for a response from a SME, or for a feature to deploy, or for final signoff. The team keeps an eye on this column for tickets that may need escalation. Putting something in Blocked rather than In Progress lets us see the status of every ticket at a glance. This column can also be used for extended time out of the office for the assigned writer, if it's work that can be safely held. (If the work cannot be held while you're out, find another writer to step in and take over.) Once you're un-blocked, move the ticket to the appropriate column. If the ticket remains blocked at the end of the current sprint, it will need to be re-reviewed during backlog grooming to determine if the ticket will carry-over into the upcoming sprint, or return to the backlog until a future sprint. Done This step is for work that is 100% finished. Work gets cleared out this column before we start a new sprint. Incomplete (\"carry-over\") tickets Ticket don't carry over automatically between sprints. Instead, any ticket that gets carried over is treated as a \"new\" ticket in the next sprint planning. Before sprint planning, review any open tickets in the board that are assigned to you and figure out what to do with them. For each open ticket assigned to you (or \"carry over\"), decide if you should: Recommended: Clone the ticket and close the old one. This is the best option for partially completed work because it makes metrics easier. If you do: Clone the ticket. Note why we closed the ticket. Add an estimate of points completed in the Points Completed field. Create a follow-up ticket if necessary. Move the ticket to the next sprint. If you do: Review the ticket's action items and description to make sure they're still current. Clear out the ticket points. Move the ticket back to the backlog. If you do: Update the action items and description to make sure they're still current. Note why we moved to the backlog rather than carry over. ← Planning poker Liaisonships → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "Like most agile teams, we divide up the roles on our team into team members, scrum masters, product owners, and managers. We treat some of those roles differently than a traditional engineer-centric scrum team: We combine the role of team manager and product owner into one person. Each writer is responsible for \"liaisonships\" where they track work across a particular product or feature and bring in appropriate stories. We don't expect scrum masters to clear blockers (that's a manager's job), and scrum mastering is not a full-time job. We divide the team further into two squads, each with its own team members, scrum master, and product owners. Team member Team members are responsible for: Doing writing work. Improving the team's processes and how we work together. Writing stories for sprints in accordance with their work (via laisionships, SME conversations, hero work, etc.). The person who nominates a story will also present it during sprint planning. See Ticket best practices for tips on writing a good ticket. Most team members will be assigned one or more Liaisonships (project assignments). Liaisons are responsible for nominating stories for sprints from other teams. Scrum master Each squad has a scrum master. The scrum master is not responsible for unblocking stories or communicating with stakeholders on behalf of the team (this work belongs to individual writers and their manager). We believe this lets the business have a single point of accountability (managers) for decisions, and ensures scrum masters have hands-on experience of what it's like to be a writer. Instead, for us the scrum master is a custodian of the sprint process and the MC for sprint meetings. In backlog grooming: The scrum master handles the mechanics of talking through each ticket and facilitating conversations about story quality. In sprint planning: The scrum master leads conversation, tracks discussion time, adds point values to stories, and organizes/ranks sprint candidates in real time. They don't present the stories, though—stories should be introduced by the person who nominated the story for the sprint. In retros: The scrum master facilitates the discussion, captures action items, and takes notes. Tech Docs managers (and product owner) Each squad has a manager---or perhaps you could say each manager has a squad. Either way, the manager's role is to prioritize the right work for the business, maintain a healthy workload, and help escalate when a writer needs help. The managers are responsible for understanding how our entire body of work serves the organization, and making informed decisions about our velocity and workload. The manager engages with other teams to know which features may be coming into the pipeline and has a general understanding of work that may be in future sprints. This lets them make final priority decisions for the team and be accountable to the business for those tradeoffs. The manager is also responsible for assigning liaisonships and ensuring we're covering the portfolio. They'll also work with other teams to unblock writers when needed. Key stakeholders Our key internal stakeholders include PMs, engineers, designers, and executives. Writers work with the stakeholders to know when new work is coming, and to communicate documentation needs/timelines. We should ensure our stakeholders know that we work in two week sprints, so that they can give us adequate lead time and get their documentation needs met. ← Key agile principles Meetings and ceremonies → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "Planning poker is a consensus-based estimating and planning technique. To start a planning poker session, the story reporter or liaison presents a story to the team. Then, the team all votes (at the same time, to prevent groupthink) on how difficult they think the story is. Most agile teams that estimate with planning poker use cards that follow a Fibonacci sequence. We've found over the years that those large jumps weren't very helpful to us in estimating, and that we estimated better with smaller numbers. So we use fairly small, granular numbers that roughly break down to 1 point ≈ 1 day. Note that even though each of the possible scores have approximate time values associated with them, we vote in points, not time. Scoring with points prevents getting into weedsy debates about exactly how long something will take, and instead focuses us on the requirements and difficulty of the story. Poker card definitions These how we define our poker cards: Card Value ¼ An hour or two. Anything smaller than this isn't worth bringing into a sprint or even ticketing—just do it right now. ½ About half of an \"ideal\" day. We define an \"ideal\" day as one without meetings or interruptions. Using \"ideal\" days makes it easier to estimate a story without litigating the details of how we spend our time. 1 About one \"ideal\" day. This is one of our most common story sizes. 1½ About one and a half \"ideal\" days. This is our other most common story size. 2 About two \"ideal\" days. 3 About three \"ideal\" days. We jump from 2 straight to 3 to avoid unrealistic granularity in our estimates. 5 About a week of work. 7 About a full sprint (two weeks) of work. We very rarely use this card—a ticket that takes a full sprint on its own is almost always too large and should be chunked into smaller, incremental tickets. Break! \"I need a break.\" When someone plays a break card, we finish estimating the current story then immediately take a five minute break. Defer No strong opinion. Don't play this card on the first round of poker! Seeing wildly different estimates is a sign we don't have a shared understanding of the work. Playing an early Defer card can mask that uncertainty. How we calculate the points budget In order to ensure we're not filling up our sprint with more \"ideal days\" of time than we realistically have available, we calculate the points budget based on the actual output of the team. Over time, we've found writers average 0.6 (technically, 0.57) points per day. Tip This value is totally unique to each team! A high number doesn't indicate a more productive team, and a low number isn't a problem. Story points are only meaningful within a team. If you're starting a new team or new process, you'll need to zero in on the ideal number of points per writer. An easy way to figure out the right budget is to have the team vote in retro on whether to increase, decrease, or keep the same budget next sprint. You'll overshoot or undershoot a few times, but after a couple sprints you'll get a good sense of what constistutes a sustainable pace. Once you know your baseline, calculating the budget is straightforward: Take the number of writers, and multiply by the number of days in the sprint. To make the math easy, let's say 5 writers and a 10 business day (2 calendar week) sprint. Or, 50 person-days total. Subtract out time off days, plus 1 day for each day of hero duty. Let's say we have 1 writer on vacation in Maui, and 1 day of hero time per day. 50 person days, minus 10 days of vacation and 10 days of hero time, gives us 30 person-days. Multiply the number of days times the average velocity per writer, per day. Our average velocity is 0.6 points/writer/day. 30 person days multiplied by 0.6 would give us an 18 point budget for the sprint. Because we work in two squads, we calculate a separate points budget for each squad ahead of sprint planning. ← Meetings and ceremonies Sprint workflow and Jira boards → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "A properly instrumented system gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation, and reduce the impact to other ongoing changes. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial and set the appropriate KPI targets for your applications. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and to prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they’re consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make are correct across them, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. 2. Add automated deployment markers It’s important to track deployments and how the impact of the code and infrastructure changes you make affect customer experience. APM’s deployment markers feature allows you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (such metadata typically includes the user, revision, change-log, etc.). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker”, on charts and graphs at the deployment event’s timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application, and additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. Tip New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_depoyment) Jenkins Ansible 3. Test your pipeline with infrastructure An important part of a successful DevOps transformation is a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. Our infrastructure agent helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names which fits this model quite nicely. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Week 1 Sprint retro (every other sprint) Backlog grooming (end of sprint) Sprint planning (start of new sprint) Team meeting Meeting-free day Week 2 Team meeting Meeting-free day We break our work into two-week sprints. The new sprint starts on a Tuesday with sprint planning, where we commit to a set of stories that we're confident we can complete by the end of the sprint. Near the end of the sprint, we prepare for the next sprint with backlog grooming. The sprint closes with a retro where we discuss what went right and what went wrong, and then we kick off a new cycle. Each squad does their own backlog grooming and sprint planning, and manages their sprint backlog independently. We do retros together so we can talk through issues that affect both squads and share expertise and ideas. Tip Why do we end sprints on Mondays and start Tuesdays? This funny schedule makes things easier to work across timezones. If we ended sprints on Fridays, our Barcelona-based writers would need to do retros and grooming on Friday evening, and who wants that? Sprint planning On the first Tuesday of a new sprint, we commit to a series of stories until we have filled our capacity for the sprint. This is the largest meeting in the sprint---about 60 to 90 minutes. Before the sprint planning meeting, the scrum master for each squad calculates their point budget. Then, during the meeting: We select the highest priority item in the backlog. The person who nominated the story introduces it, and the team asks questions until everyone feels ready to vote. The team plays planning poker. Everyone secretly chooses a card, then we reveal them at the same time: If everyone picks the same card, that's the point value and we move on. If there's an even split between two cards, we choose the larger and move on. If it's mixed, the highest and lowest voters briefly explain their votes. Then we vote again. Once we're sure we can fit the story in, we subtract its story points from the sprint's points budget. We repeat the above steps until we've used up our points budget. We generally avoid pre-assigning people to stories during sprint planning. Instead, we pick up the next story or peer edit in the To Do column as stories are completed. Backlog grooming The day before the sprint starts, we do two rounds of backlog grooming. The purpose of backlog grooming is to prioritize work for sprint planning, and identify stories that need to be fixed before sprint planning to ensure scope is clear and planning runs smoothly. The first round of backlog grooming is by squad, where the members and manager of the squad get together and work through the grooming checklist. Then we do a second round of grooming with the managers and scrum masters to look at the sprint backlog for both squads and ensure nothing is or has fallen through the cracks. In the grooming, we: Each writer brings their personal \"top five\" tickets. The manager works with writers to prioritize those into a single, stack-ranked list for the team. We talk through stories and ensure they look ready for sprint planning (essentially, do they fit the Checklist for story readiness?). After grooming, the scrum master sends out a list of \"homework\" for stories that need improving. Retro Every other sprint, we conduct a 60 minute retrospective meeting, where we discuss: How do we feel about the sprint? What went well? Where can we improve? Anything we should start or stop doing? The goal of the retro is to improve the way we work together. That could be related to the sprint process, to how we collaborate with SMEs, to peer edits, and so on. ← Agile roles Planning poker → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "All of our sprint work is tracked in Jira. The workflow depends on what type of work we're dealing with: Planned or unplanned (\"surprise!\") work. Planned work Planned work includes all work that is currently in our backlog or has been added to the current sprint as a result of a Sprint Planning session. This could include writing or updating documentation, research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Unplanned work (surprises!) Usually, we get notified of major requests far enough in advance that we can include them in liaison project plans, backlog grooming, and sprint planning. Occasionally, something bigger surprises us that needs emergency support. Follow this process with new docs asks to assess the scope of work and ensure we address valid docs needs within a reasonable amount of time. Our goal is to treat the sprint as sacred and insulate against \"surprise\" work that is not absolutely crucial. But we also want to ensure we're providing good internal customer service, and not getting hung up on process niceties for things that are small. Jira boards: Backlog and future sprints This is where the vast majority of tickets spend their time. Most tickets (even for active projects) spend at least a little time here before moving into a sprint to be actively worked. Being in the backlog doesn't mean something isn't important---just that we haven't committed to it yet.  You can also add tickets straight to a future sprint. This is where tickets tentatively assigned to a future sprint will be found. Tickets can be assigned here to be held for backlog grooming and sprint planning.  Jira boards: Current sprint Proposed This step is for work that has been assigned to the current sprint during Sprint Planning and is available to be picked up by a tech writer. When you're ready to take on a new ticket, try to work the queue from the top-down and avoid cherry picking. It's also better to pick up Needs Peer Edit tickets before committing to a new ticket. Something that needs a peer edit is close to done, and helping things across the finish line helps get value into users hands, and frees us up to think about new problems. In Progress This step is for all of the work to be done by the assignee: Research, meeting with SMEs, information architecture, writing, incorporating peer edits, SME review, and so on. Tickets are moved to this step once work is started by the TW, and remain here until the work is either complete, ready for peer review, or it becomes blocked. If additional large edits are needed after the peer review, the ticket can be moved back to In Progress for those edits. Needs Peer Editor Work that is ready for a peer edit. Once a peer editor picks it up, they move it into In Peer Edit. In Peer Edit This step is for a peer editor to review docs before they go live. Follow the Peer editor workflow, then move the ticket into Peer Edit Done.  Peer Edit Done This step is a holding state once peer editing is complete. After completing their peer edit and delivering their feedback, the peer editor moves the ticket into Peer Edit Done. From there, the assignee on the ticket (not the peer editor) moves the ticket into the appropriate column (In Progress, Blocked, or Closed). Minor edits can be completed from this column but for major doc rework, the ticket should be moved back into the In Progress column. Blocked This step is for tickets that cannot be moved forward by the team. This could be because we're waiting for a response from a SME, or for a feature to deploy, or for final signoff. The team keeps an eye on this column for tickets that may need escalation. Putting something in Blocked rather than In Progress lets us see the status of every ticket at a glance. This column can also be used for extended time out of the office for the assigned writer, if it's work that can be safely held. (If the work cannot be held while you're out, find another writer to step in and take over.) Once you're un-blocked, move the ticket to the appropriate column. If the ticket remains blocked at the end of the current sprint, it will need to be re-reviewed during backlog grooming to determine if the ticket will carry-over into the upcoming sprint, or return to the backlog until a future sprint. Done This step is for work that is 100% finished. Work gets cleared out this column before we start a new sprint. Incomplete (\"carry-over\") tickets Ticket don't carry over automatically between sprints. Instead, any ticket that gets carried over is treated as a \"new\" ticket in the next sprint planning. Before sprint planning, review any open tickets in the board that are assigned to you and figure out what to do with them. For each open ticket assigned to you (or \"carry over\"), decide if you should: Recommended: Clone the ticket and close the old one. This is the best option for partially completed work because it makes metrics easier. If you do: Clone the ticket. Note why we closed the ticket. Add an estimate of points completed in the Points Completed field. Create a follow-up ticket if necessary. Move the ticket to the next sprint. If you do: Review the ticket's action items and description to make sure they're still current. Clear out the ticket points. Move the ticket back to the backlog. If you do: Update the action items and description to make sure they're still current. Note why we moved to the backlog rather than carry over. ← Planning poker Liaisonships → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "New Relic infrastructure integrations include an integration for reporting your AWS Billing data to New Relic. This document explains how to activate this integration and describes the data that can be reported. Features New Relic's AWS Billing integration collects financial data for all your applications and AWS accounts, and then groups it to make it easier for teams to gain cost visibility. This integration collects data from different sub-accounts and services, and also evaluates your AWS budgets in terms of actual spend and forecasted spend. This financial data is split into the following dashboards: Billing (Costs) dashboard Billing (Budgets) dashboard Requirements Before you enable AWS budgets, you must: Set up an AWS budget through AWS Console for New Relic to collect AWS Billing data. Enable the Receive Billing Alerts checkbox in AWS console > Billing > Billing preferences. This is necessary for Amazon to report usage fees via CloudWatch. You are not required to actually receive alerts from Amazon. Important You only need to enable the Receive Billing Alerts checkbox to access the Billing (Costs) dashboard. Activate integration To enable this integration follow standard procedures to Connect AWS services to New Relic. Enable AWS budgets Enabling AWS budgets allows New Relic to capture service consumptions as well as usage and costs information for the budgets you configured in AWS. Tip If you have not created a role in AWS, follow the procedure to connect AWS to New Relic before configuring a budget policy. From the AWS Management console, select Services > IAM > Roles. Select the role you have configured for New Relic, then select Permissions. From the selected role's Inline policy tab, select the expand icon if one already exists, or select the option to add a new inline policy to the role. Select the option to add a custom policy. Enter a new custom policy name; for example, NewRelicBudget. Enter the following permission statement in the Policy Document: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"budgets:ViewBudget\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy Save your changes. Tip If you're configuring New Relic to fetch AWS budgets data from an AWS member account, make sure that the account owner has activated IAM user access to the Billing and Cost Management console. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS and select one of the AWS Billing integration links. For general information about how to find and use integration data, see Understand integration data. Data is attached to the FinanceSample event type. That event type can have four different provider values, depending on the type of billing data: Budgets AWS service expenses Aggregated account and sub-account expenses Unaggregated account/sub-account data, and unaggregated AWS service expenses Details for these types of billing data and how to query them are below: Budgets Data from the BillingBudget provider is related to AWS budgets. This data allows you to monitor: Money spent on a budget Limits you set for each budget Forecasted expenses You can configure budgets based on usage or expense, in different currencies, or for a monthly, quarterly, or annual time period. Budgets are a great tool to monitor and control costs and take advantage of the AWS predictive model to see forecasted costs. NRQL example: For a table of different budgets with actual spend, forecast, limits, and usage vs. monetary cost, run the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(`provider.budgetType`) as 'Budget Type', max(`provider.actualAmount`) as 'Actual Amount', max(`provider.limitAmount`) as 'Budget Limit', latest(`provider.forecastedAmount`) as 'Forecast' FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider='BillingBudget' AND providerAccountId = 'NEW_RELIC_ID_FOR_YOUR_CLOUD_ACCOUNT' FACET `provider.budgetName` SINCE 1 day ago Copy Tip The providerAccountId is your cloud service account ID in New Relic. You can find it in one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, next to Provider account. Aggregated service costs The data stored in the BillingServiceCost provider is aggregated for service costs containing the latest and most recent data for all AWS service costs in all registered accounts. Tip If you have configured multiple AWS accounts, New Relic recommends filtering by each account with the attribute providerAccountName or providerAccountId. NRQL example: To group providers by service names, run the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(`provider.estimatedCharges.Maximum`) FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider='BillingServiceCost' AND providerAccountId = 'NEW_RELIC_ID_FOR_YOUR_CLOUD_ACCOUNT' SINCE 1 day ago FACET `provider.serviceName` LIMIT 20 Copy Tip The providerAccountId is your cloud service account ID in New Relic. You can find it in one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, next to Provider account. Aggregated account/subaccount costs The BillingAccountCost provider stores aggregated data for account and sub-accounts containing the latest and most recent aggregate of financial data. Please bear in mind that if you have many AWS Accounts configured it is recommended to filter by each account with the attribute providerAccountName or providerAccountId. NRQL example: To group providers by account names, run the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(`provider.estimatedCharges.Maximum`) FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider='BillingAccountCost' AND providerAccountId = 'NEW_RELIC_ID_FOR_YOUR_CLOUD_ACCOUNT' SINCE 1 day ago FACET `provider.accountId` LIMIT 20 Copy Tip The providerAccountId is your cloud service account ID in New Relic. You can find it in one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, next to Provider account. Unaggregated account/subaccount and AWS service costs The BillingAccountServiceCost provider contains unaggregated data filterable by AWS account ID or AWS service name. NRQL example: To understand the cost split of AWS services for a particular AWS account ID, run the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(`provider.estimatedCharges.Maximum`) FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider='BillingAccountServiceCost' AND providerAccountId = 'NEW_RELIC_ID_FOR_YOUR_CLOUD_ACCOUNT' SINCE 1 day ago FACET `provider.serviceName` LIMIT 100 Copy NRQL example: To understand the cost split of AWS accounts for your AWS EC2 service, run the following NRQL query: SELECT latest(`provider.estimatedCharges.Maximum`) FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider='BillingAccountServiceCost' AND providerAccountId = 'NEW_RELIC_ID_FOR_YOUR_CLOUD_ACCOUNT' AND `provider.serviceName`='AmazonEC2' FACET `provider.accountId` SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 100 Copy Tip The providerAccountId is your cloud service account ID in New Relic. You can find it in one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, next to Provider account. Configuration and polling You can change the polling frequency and filter data using configuration options. Default polling information for the AWS Billing integration: New Relic polling interval: 1 hour Amazon CloudWatch data interval: 4 hours Metric data The New Relic infrastructure AWS Billing integration collects the following metric data: Data Description AWS Billing metrics EstimatedCharges: The estimated charges for your AWS usage. This can either be estimated charges for one service or a rollup of estimated charges for all services. The currency is USD. AWS Budgets metrics actualAmount: The actual cost or usage being tracked by a budget. limitAmount: The total amount of cost or usage that you want to track with a budget as an upper limit. forecastedAmount: The forecasted cost or usage being tracked by a budget. Inventory data Inventory data provides information about the service's state and configuration. For more about inventory data, see Understand and use data. Name Description /budgets name: The name of a budget. Unique within accounts. startTime: Start date for the period of time covered by a budget. endTime: End date for the period of time covered by a budget. limitAmount: The total amount of cost or usage that you want to track with a budget as an upper limit. limitUnit: The unit of measurement used for the budget forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB. timeUnit: The length of time until a budget resets the actual and forecasted spend. Valid values: monthly, quarterly, annually. type: Whether this budget tracks monetary cost or usage. /budgets/costFilters name: The name of a budget. Unique within accounts. Other system data The AWS Billing integration also collects the following attributes: Attributes Description AWS Billing attributes Service Name: The name of the AWS service. This dimension is omitted for the total of estimated charges across all services. Linked Account: The linked account number. AWS Budgets attributes budgetName: The name of a budget. Unique within accounts budgetType: Whether the budget tracks monetary cost or usage",

      "body": "Our team uses an agile Sprint workflow in Jira and GitHub to manage our work. We've further divided our team into squads to simplify planning and improve accountability. All those words are pretty inconsistent in their usage, so let's break them down further. Agile People use agile to mean everything from a specific system of work (which we call sprints), to just \"moving fast, preferably in a way that lets me bend things to my whims.\" Luckily, we don't need to define it from scratch. Wikipedia does an admirable job defining it: Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, empirical knowledge, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. For our team, that means our process is optimized to ship early and often. This lets us respond swiftly to changes in the product roadmap. More importantly, it ensures we validate our solutions with stakeholders, and that we're not letting valuable work sit around and get moldy when it could be out in the world making our users' lives better. Sprint (or scrum) This is the particular flavor of agile we follow. The sprint system (often referred to as scrum) is one major approach to Agile, along with other Agile systems such as Kanban. Sprint systems are often accompanied by a lot of jargon and best practices, but for our team the most essential elements are: Working in strict timeboxes (two weeks in our case) Planning that sprint in advance, and not changing the scope of the sprint (much) once it starts Expecting all team members to contribute to making the sprint a success The video Agile Product Ownership in a Nutshell (18 minutes) is an excellent resource for learning about sprint methodology. The Kindle book Scrum: a Breathtakingly Brief and Agile Introduction is also a great read that you can get through in a short afternoon. For more on the \"why\" of Sprint as our chosen methodology, see Key agile principles. And for more on the \"how,\" see Sprint workflow. Jira and GitHub issues Jira and GitHub issues are the tools we use to manage our Agile workflow. If you remember one thing about them, it should be this: using Jira or GitHub issues is not the same as having an agile workflow. They're powerful tools for tracking work and managing a backlog, but the most important part of project management is the structure we impose on that tool. Jira is for sprint work. Sprints are where roadmap docs get written, monthly commits get delivered, and deeper research percolates. We have a backlog, board, and future sprint list in Jira that help us track what people want, what's coming up, and what we're working on now. For more on the mechanics of how we use Jira, see Sprint workflow and Jira boards and Ticket best practices. We use GitHub projects for hero work, customer-reported issues, and managing the flow of PRs and edits. The Docs PRs and Issues board contains everything we're actively working on in GitHub. We'll often connect work in GitHub back to Jira by putting a Jira issue key in the PR or issue title (DOC-1234, for example). For more on the mechanics of how we use GitHub, see Managing the GitHub boards. Teams and squads Our team is the Tech Docs team. We're collectively responsible for docs.newrelic.com and sundry writing content. Our team is further divided into two agile squads (The Odd Squad and The Amp Squad), one squad for each manager. The primary function of squads is to simplify sprint planning, backlog grooming, and liaisonships. Less people means shorter meetings. It also means better information sharing: The more people you have in a group, the more lines of communication are needed (see illustration) to maintain a shared understanding. Small squads can collaborate more easily than a large team, because not everyone needs to keep in mind everything that goes on everywhere. Each squad is responsible for its own grooming and sprint planning, but the managers and scrum masters coordinate grooming to ensure we're meeting our overall goals as a team.

      "body": "Planning poker is a consensus-based estimating and planning technique. To start a planning poker session, the story reporter or liaison presents a story to the team. Then, the team all votes (at the same time, to prevent groupthink) on how difficult they think the story is. Most agile teams that estimate with planning poker use cards that follow a Fibonacci sequence. We've found over the years that those large jumps weren't very helpful to us in estimating, and that we estimated better with smaller numbers. So we use fairly small, granular numbers that roughly break down to 1 point ≈ 1 day. Note that even though each of the possible scores have approximate time values associated with them, we vote in points, not time. Scoring with points prevents getting into weedsy debates about exactly how long something will take, and instead focuses us on the requirements and difficulty of the story. Poker card definitions These how we define our poker cards: Card Value ¼ An hour or two. Anything smaller than this isn't worth bringing into a sprint or even ticketing—just do it right now. ½ About half of an \"ideal\" day. We define an \"ideal\" day as one without meetings or interruptions. Using \"ideal\" days makes it easier to estimate a story without litigating the details of how we spend our time. 1 About one \"ideal\" day. This is one of our most common story sizes. 1½ About one and a half \"ideal\" days. This is our other most common story size. 2 About two \"ideal\" days. 3 About three \"ideal\" days. We jump from 2 straight to 3 to avoid unrealistic granularity in our estimates. 5 About a week of work. 7 About a full sprint (two weeks) of work. We very rarely use this card—a ticket that takes a full sprint on its own is almost always too large and should be chunked into smaller, incremental tickets. Break! \"I need a break.\" When someone plays a break card, we finish estimating the current story then immediately take a five minute break. Defer No strong opinion. Don't play this card on the first round of poker! Seeing wildly different estimates is a sign we don't have a shared understanding of the work. Playing an early Defer card can mask that uncertainty. How we calculate the points budget In order to ensure we're not filling up our sprint with more \"ideal days\" of time than we realistically have available, we calculate the points budget based on the actual output of the team. Over time, we've found writers average 0.6 (technically, 0.57) points per day. Tip This value is totally unique to each team! A high number doesn't indicate a more productive team, and a low number isn't a problem. Story points are only meaningful within a team. If you're starting a new team or new process, you'll need to zero in on the ideal number of points per writer. An easy way to figure out the right budget is to have the team vote in retro on whether to increase, decrease, or keep the same budget next sprint. You'll overshoot or undershoot a few times, but after a couple sprints you'll get a good sense of what constistutes a sustainable pace. Once you know your baseline, calculating the budget is straightforward: Take the number of writers, and multiply by the number of days in the sprint. To make the math easy, let's say 5 writers and a 10 business day (2 calendar week) sprint. Or, 50 person-days total. Subtract out time off days, plus 1 day for each day of hero duty. Let's say we have 1 writer on vacation in Maui, and 1 day of hero time per day. 50 person days, minus 10 days of vacation and 10 days of hero time, gives us 30 person-days. Multiply the number of days times the average velocity per writer, per day. Our average velocity is 0.6 points/writer/day. 30 person days multiplied by 0.6 would give us an 18 point budget for the sprint. Because we work in two squads, we calculate a separate points budget for each squad ahead of sprint planning. ← Meetings and ceremonies Sprint workflow and Jira boards → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "For large projects, we'll typically assign a particular tech writer to that project as a \"liaison.\" The liaison’s job is to ensure that we get complete, consistent, and timely docs. Not every project gets a liaisonship! For smaller projects, we'll encourage teams to edit the docs directly, and then have the hero review their changes. And a smallish project may not need a full liaison—a single ticket might be enough to manage the work. To figure out which type of support is best for a given project, one of the managers on the team will have a scoping conversation with a subject matter expert. Here's a few reasons a project might get a dedicated liaison: Project is complex and would benefit from intimate familiarity with the feature. Project requires significant information architecture work. Project will produce enough docs that consistency across those docs will be hard to achieve without a centralized editor. Project SMEs would benefit from a consistent \"face\" of the tech writing team. However, a liaison is not the only author on a project. Liaisons should structure their work to maximize swarming and knowledge sharing. Liaison responsibilities: Manage project flow Activity Who? Notes Learn new thing exists Team Ideally the Hero or a Tech Docs manager gets notified directly by a PM about a new project. But sometimes we'll find out about something unexpectedly. If you're not sure whether we have a writer working on something, ask a manager on the team and they'll reach out to the subject matter expert to scope it. Have a scoping meeting Tech Docs manager The manager is responsible for tracking the general state of major projects across the company, and is generally the first point of contact for new projects. When a large new project comes up, the manager will do a pre-scope meeting with the requestor. (Appendix: Project scoping cheatsheet has a list of common questions for this pre-scope meeting.) That conversation helps figure out timeline, complexity, key docs considerations, and which writer will be a good fit as liaison. Assign a liaison Tech Docs manager Once we know we need a liaison, a manager on our team will figure out who to assign. Some of the factors we use to decide who to assign include bandwidth, familiarity with the product or feature, career goals and writing strengths, and simple interest in the topic. Keep track of project dates Liaison The managers on the team keep track of upcoming projects that don't have a liaison assigned. Once a writer gets involved, that liaison keeps track of the specifics of dates: Betas, limited releases, GAs, fast-follows, and so on. Your manager's always here to help out if you're getting blocked or dates are shifting too rapidly to plan properly. Validate the docs plan with the project team Liaison The liaison works with their stakeholders to define the information architecture and deliverables. Create tickets Liaison Since the liaison defines the information architecture, the liaison will know what kinds of deliverables we need. The liaison also acts as an advocate for their tickets in the backlog grooming and sprint planning processes, and ensures their stories meet the story quality requirements. The liaison should also ensure that our partner teams have appropriate tickets in their backlogs for their work. Remove blockers (such as reviewer delay) Liaison + Manager While the liaison is primarily responsible for handling SME relationships and removing day-to-day blockers, your manager is here to help unstick things anytime you need help. Wrap up the liaisonship Liaison Liaisonships are not forever assignments! When the bulk of your work on a project is complete, it might be time to consider ending the liaisonship. Reach out to your manager to talk about it. When you end it, let stakeholders know and update the liaison roster. Also let your stakeholders know they can always ping the docs hero for help or if they have a new project. Liaison responsibilities: Build expertise Activity Who? Notes Develop a deep expertise on feature and audience. Liaison Become the Docs Team's local expert on the feature. Understand what it does, what problems it solves, and the implications for our content. Educate the team on the feature Liaison Part of your responsibility as liaison is to share expertise around the team. That helps with swarming, but it also makes for better hero review and a smarter team that can write more intelligently about the entire New Relic One platform. Coordinate with design and/or research and test your docs Liaison Reach out to the designer and/or researcher for the project, and periodically sync on any shared concerns, user needs, etc. And you should advocate for user testing and validation of your content. Liaison responsibilities: Define content strategy (oh, and do the writing) Activity Who? Notes Define the information architecture Liaison As liaison, you're the expert on both the feature the product team is building, and the docs content (new and existing) that will support that feature. Build an IA that will meet all project needs and scale to the future. Write content Team The liaison writes much of the content for their project, especially the conceptual content like intro docs. But the whole team is expected to swarm and contribute to large projects, with the liaison coordinating that work. Peer edit drafts Liaison When we swarm and have someone else contribute to the project, the liaison peer edits their drafts to ensure consistency with the overall vision. Coordinate publication Liaison When the time comes to release (whether that's beta, GA, limited release, or EoL), it's the liaison's job to coordinate with PM, Eng, and Product Marketing to ensure docs go out on time with other deliverables. ← Sprint workflow and Jira boards What is a hero? → Tip We welcome thoughts or questions on our handbook!

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted).

View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string. Muting examples For more information about making requests to NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph documentation, including GraphQL tutorials.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Datarobot (formerly Algorithmia) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Datarobot for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity.

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Datarobot (formerly Algorithmia) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Datarobot for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed. Types include latency, throughput, and error_rate. entity object The entity that reported the unusual data. entity.accountId number The ID for the entity's account. entity.domain enum The domain for the entity.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts. Tip Adding alerts as a source will not affect your current configuration or notifications. Datarobot (formerly Algorithmia) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Datarobot machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure Datarobot for Incident Intelligence, see our integration docs. Aporia (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Aporia machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Aporia integration, see our docs. Superwise (MLOps) By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Superwise machine-learning models, you can monitor your machine learning model performance. To configure our Superwise integration, see our docs. Anomalies By integrating Incident Intelligence with your New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from New Relic Proactive Detection anomalies: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Anomalies. Select the configurations you want to connect to Applied Intelligence by toggling to on (green). To add or remove alert policies, from Alerts & AI, click Sources, then Alerts. Tip Adding anomalies as a source won't affect your current Proactive Detection configurations or notifications. AWS You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Amazon CloudWatch to provide incident management for all of your AWS services. To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

      "body": "As part of Applied Intelligence, Incident Intelligence helps you correlate your incidents and reduce noise in your environment. It gives you an overview of all your incidents, their sources, and related events. Requirements If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. To use most Applied Intelligence features, you must be a full platform user. For more information, see user type capabilities. Set up Incident Intelligence To enable Incident Intelligence, follow these steps. Afterwards, issues should start to appear in your issue feed. 1. Configure your environment (one-time). 2. Configure sources. 3. Configure destinations. 4. Configure pathways. 1. Configure your environment (one-time) To set up an environment in Incident Intelligence, you need an administrator to select a New Relic account for it. This account should be the one your team is using. Who sets the environment? Only administrators, and only for accounts where they have admin privileges. Can administrators set more than one environment? They can set one environment per parent account and its child accounts. More than one can be set if an administrator has privileges for more than one parent account. Tip Incident Intelligence is a cross-account product. This means you can send in data from any New Relic account or external source to correlate events. 2. Configure sources After setting up your environment, determine your incident sources. These are your data inputs. You can get data from any of the following sources: Alerts By integrating Incident Intelligence with your alerts violations, you can get context and correlations from what you're monitoring. To get data from alerts: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Alerts. Select the policies you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional alerts policies or remove policies you've already connected in Sources > New Relic Alerts.

To integrate Amazon CloudWatch: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Amazon Web Services. Copy the URL. Create a new Amazon SNS topic. Set CloudWatch to forward all Alarms state changes to that topic: In the Amazon CloudWatch UI, click Events > Event Pattern. Select Service Name > CloudWatch. Select Event Type > CloudWatch Alarm State Change. Select Targets > SNS Topic, and select your new Amazon SNS topic. Create a new subscription: In the Amazon AWS UI, click Create a Subscription. Select your new Amazon SNS topic. Select Protocol > choose HTTPS. In Endpoint, paste the URL you previously copied from the Applied Intelligence Sources. Grafana You can integrate Incident Intelligence with Grafana's notifications for insight into events across your applications and environment. Grafana's webhook notification is a simple way to send information over HTTP to a custom endpoint. To integrate Grafana as a new webhook: Log into your Grafana portal using Admin permissions, and choose Alerting. On the Grafana Notification Channels page, click New Channel > Webhook. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources, and then click Grafana. Copy the URL, and paste it into your new Grafana webhook. PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. You can integrate Incident Intelligence directly with your PagerDuty services to ingest, process, and enhance all of your PagerDuty incidents. Connecting PagerDuty services to Applied Intelligence will not affect your current services or notifications. To get data from PagerDuty: Make sure your PagerDuty API key has write access. From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. You can add additional services or remove services you've already connected in Sources > PagerDuty. Prometheus Alertmanager By integrating Incident Intelligence with Prometheus Alertmanager, you can receive and correlate your Prometheus alerts with events from other sources. To integrate Prometheus Alertmanager: Set up your Alertmanager configuration file by running: ./alertmanager -config.file=simple.yml Copy Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Prometheus Alertmanager. Copy the Prometheus Alertmanager URL, and paste it into the <webhook_config>/url section of your Alertmanager config file. Reload the Prometheus Alertmanager configuration with one of the two methods: Send a SIGHUP to the process. Send an HTTP POST request to the /-/reload endpoint. REST API Incident Intelligence supports a dedicated REST API interface that lets you integrate with additional systems. The interface allows instrumentation of your code or other monitoring solutions to report any kind of metric or event. A metric can be a raw data point such as CPU, memory, disk utilization, or business KPI. An event can be a monitoring alert, deployment event, incident, exceptions or any other change in state that you want to describe. You can also send any type of data to Incident Intelligence straight from your own systems or applications. The REST API supports secure token-based authentication and accepts JSON content as input. For more information on authentication and the full API reference, see REST API for New Relic Applied Intelligence. Splunk By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Splunk log monitoring, you can: Use your environment's log data for searches and key term reports. Correlate alerts and search reports with your other metrics and incidents. Important Applied Intelligence supports Splunk Light, Splunk Cloud, and Splunk Enterprise version 6.3 and higher. To get data from Splunk: In your Splunk console, start a search for the relevant events. Save your search as an alert, configure your alert conditions, and then choose the webhook as the delivery method. Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. On the left under Incident Intelligence, click Sources and then click Splunk. Copy the collector URL, and paste it into the webhook endpoint in the Splunk console. Optional: Use Splunk tokens to enrich alert data with Splunk metadata. Splunk metadata To enrich alerts data with your Splunk metadata, use Splunk tokens. This helps you leverage your search data, which includes metadata and values from the first row of search results. If you want to... Do this... Access search data Use the format $<fieldname>$. For example, use $app$ for the app context for the search. Access field values To access field values from the first result row that a search returns, use the format $result.<fieldname>$. For example, use $result.host$ for the host value and $result.sourcetype$ for the source type. Use variables You can leverage any of the Selected fields in the Splunk search and add any unique fields to the Selected fields to make the data available as a variable. The following fields will automatically provide hints to the correlation engine: app: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application:parsed as APPLICATION_NAME application_name: parsed as APPLICATION_NAME cluster: parsed as CLUSTER_NAME computer: parsed as HOST_NAME Dc: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME datacenter: parsed as DATACENTER_NAME host: parsed as HOST_NAME host_name: parsed as HOST_NAME hostname: parsed as HOST_NAME transaction: parsed as EVENT_ID Transaction_id: parsed as EVENT_ID user: parsed as USER_NAME 3. Configure destinations (ServiceNow and others) Now that you've set up your sources, you can configure your destinations. These are the data outputs where you view your incidents. Configure ServiceNow (example) Using ServiceNow as a destination enables you to push valuable violation data into new ServiceNow incident tickets. Send data to ServiceNow To configure Incident Intelligence to send data to ServiceNow: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click ServiceNow. Required: Enter a channel name. This is used internally in Applied Intelligence to identify the destination (for example, in Pathways). Required: Enter your ServiceNow credentials: Team domain (This must be unique. No two destinations can have the same domain). Username Password Follow the two-way integration on screen instructions: Open and download this XML file. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rule. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML, and upload the XML file you downloaded. The two way integration will allow the ServiceNow incident to be updated with changes to the Applied Intelligence issue. Closing a ServiceNow incident will close its corresponding New Relic issue. When a New Relic issue is resolved, the corresponding ServiceNow incident will be closed. Custom notification message Applied Intelligence uses a templating framework called Jinja2 in the customization section interface. The Value field must be in valid Jinja syntax. By default, the interface populates a set of default fields in ServiceNow. When you add a custom field, enter the ServiceNow field name you want to use. When you want to skip a selected field in an issue update, add the | skip_on_update string at the end of the value you've selected. Tip By default, ServiceNow adds u_ to the beginning of its custom values. When mapping to ServiceNow attributes, use the Column name value. Please note that the name needs to be lowercase separated by underscores. Go here to see the custom notification message attribute descriptions. Go here to see Jinja2 Useful Syntax. Other destinations You can set other destinations: Send data to PagerDuty EOL NOTICE As of October 2021, we've discontinued support for several capabilities with PagerDuty, including suggested responders, golden signals, and component enrichment. For more details, including how you can easily make this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Recommended: Create a new PagerDuty service to use as a destination. Because PagerDuty services can also be used as sources, this can help you distinguish your data input from your output. To create a PagerDuty destination: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click PagerDuty. Enter your PagerDuty API key. The key should be either a personal or general access key with write access. If it's created by a user, the user should be an admin. If you've configured a PagerDuty source with an API key, you can use the same key. Select the PagerDuty services you want to connect to Applied Intelligence, and click Connect. When you're ready, you can add policies for one or more PagerDuty destinations. You can also transfer the policies over from your existing services or leave them as sources if needed. From the Destinations > PagerDuty page, you can also: Review the permissions for your services. Click Authorize when you're done. Add or delete existing services from the PagerDuty destination. Edit permissions for any service. To configure your PagerDuty destinations, use the following settings: Configuration setting Description Trigger new incidents Required. Trigger correlated parent incidents so you can identify issues faster. Edit incident titles Required. Alter your incident titles to help you orient and understand issues. Add new integrations Required. Add integrations to enable incident creation for selected services. Add webhook extensions Add webhook extensions to sync user actions in PagerDuty to New Relic. This lets you update the correlated issue state. Auto-resolve correlated incidents When enabled, this will resolve and automatically close correlated parent/child incidents. Select a user to take actions in PagerDuty You need to select a user before you can enable deep integration with PagerDuty. Once you do, the user can: Add notes to incidents (required): Incident notes are used to enrich incidents with context. Acknowledge triggered incidents: When enabled, Applied Intelligence will acknowledge and correlate newly triggered incidents in PagerDuty before you're notified. Use the original escalation policy: When enabled, the escalation policy of the source service will be applied to each incident. Send data via webhook Incident Intelligence will send the event body in JSON format by HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). To configure Incident Intelligence to send data via webhook: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Destinations, then click Webhook. Required: Configure the unique webhook key, used in Applied Intelligence to refer to this webhook configuration and its specific settings. Required: Configure the destination endpoint where the webhook payload will be sent. Optional steps: Configure custom headers, which are key:value pairs of headers to be sent with the request. Example: \"Authentication\" \"Bearer\" <bearer token> Configure a custom payload template that can be used to map New Relic fields to match the destination tool's expected name and format. Configure priority mapping (critical, high, medium, or low), used to map New Relic's priorities to the priorities expected at the destination. Tip There’s a retry mechanism that is triggered a few times with exponential backoff for a couple of minutes once an error occurs. If we reach the retry limit, the Webhook will get auto-disabled. For examples of destination templates, webhook formats, and JSON schema, see the Incident Intelligence destination examples. 4. Configure pathways To control when and where you want to receive notifications from your incidents, you can configure pathways. To add a pathway: Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left nav under Incident Intelligence click Pathways, then click Add a pathway. In the query builder box, select an attribute, such as application/name. This can be from the list of all attributes available in PagerDuty incidents and New Relic alerts violations, or you can add your own attributes. Select a logical operator. For example, contains. Enter a specific value to complete the logical expression. To include all issues created by your sources, select Send everything. (Use this if you only use one PagerDuty service to manage all incidents.) To build more complex logic, use the AND/OR operators. Select one or more of your destinations. To edit or remove existing pathways, mouse over the pathway's name on the Pathways page. What's next? Now that you've set up some sources and destinations for your incidents, read about how to use Incident Intelligence.",

      "body": "With workflows you control when and where you want to receive notifications about issues, tunnel the right information to the relevant person or team, and enrich your issue's notifications with additional New Relic data. What is an issue Issues are groups of incidents that describe the underlying problem of your symptoms. When a new incident is created, Incident Intelligence opens an issue and evaluates other open issues for correlations. For more information see Use Incident Inteligence. Add a Workflow Tip The maximum number of workflows you can add is 100 per environment and 50 per account. The workflows feature is located under the Alerts & AI menu. Go to one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, in the left navigation under Enrich and Notify click Workflow, then click Add a workflow. Name your workflow. This field is mandatory and needs to be unique. Workflows filters the issues you want to send to the relevant destination. You can send all issues by selecting Send all issues or you can build a query to filter the right issues. Build a query by selecting an attribute, operator and value/s to narrow down the right issues you want to be passed on. Optional: Enriched Data, available to full platform users. Enrichments Enrichments can give additional context on alert notifications by adding NRQL query results to them The workflows enrich tool is similar to the query builder. The NRQL query's results are included in the notification message. If you create queries for your workflows, they run in real time and the query results are the value of the enricher. You can save any valid query into your workflow, even if they return an empty result, but you must run the query before saving the enrichment. You can also query with issue-specific variables; for example {{entitiesData.ids}} For enrichment examples, see Workflow data enrichment examples. Note: The query name needs to be unique because you'll use the name to decide how to include the result in the payload of the notification that will be sent by the workflow. Important At this stage, visual representation of enrichments are sent to Slack and email. For Servicenow and JIRA destinations, we recommend to limit to NRDB queries with single value results. For example: count, min, or max. The maximum number of enrichments per workflow is 5. The maximum number of variables an enrichment can contain is 1. Notify: Choose one or more destinations and add an optional message. Notifier To save and activate a Workflow, you need to include a notifier. Setting up a notifier requires having a notification destination configured. You can either set it up through the Destination menu item, or through the Create new destination item in the destination selection drop down in each destination channel screen. A notification destination includes the credentials required to send a notification to a third party platform and an option to customize the message sent by mapping fields from our issues to fields in the destination platform. To learn how to set up destinations and configure message templates, check the documentation on notifications. Click update message once completing the notifier requirements Optionally, test your workflow. We'll use existing data from your account to test what you've configured and send a sample notification Click activate to complete the workflow. Tip In any destination channel, start typing and a variable menu will open up. You'll see the names of the variables, which will be replaced with the variable's values at runtime. To use the enrichers' results, use their name.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. You can click each anomaly to bring up an automatic analysis. Notifications for anomalies can be delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. After you set up a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you're interested in), you can add this configuration as a source. Then the anomalies will be automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. To learn where anomalies appear, how you can use them to understand potential issues before they become incidents, and create alerts from them, watch this short video (approx. 4:15 minutes). Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: Full platform user access. If you haven't already, sign up for a New Relic account to get started. An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example, uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Important This feature is a limited release. We’ve expanded anomaly detection coverage beyond your APM applications. Configure anomaly detection for your browser applications, mobile applications, infrastructure hosts, and nearly anything you want to monitor. Requirements Expanded anomaly detection is available as a limited beta. You can request access here. Why it matters When starting to configure alert conditions for a variety of applications and hosts, it can be difficult to know what you’ll want to be notified about ahead of time. Anomaly detection helps you distinguish between what’s typical performance in your system and where you’re starting to have trouble. Instead of creating your alert conditions manually, you can simply tell us what you want to monitor. Anomaly detection will help you identify baseline performance in your system and flags anomalous activity in your system. Get started with anomaly detection To get started with expanded anomaly detection: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Select the account you want to use to record anomaly data, then select the workload or entities you’d like to monitor. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name your configuration and save. Detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query To detect anomalies with a faceted NRQL query: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab, and then click + Add a configuration. Click Use a query instead. You may need to select an account, if you have more than one. Add one or more queries with a FACET clause. Name the query and confirm the facets you want to monitor for anomalies. Select the detection sensitivity. We recommend Low sensitivity so that you don’t see too many anomalies. Finally, name the configuration and save. See your anomalies in one place When you set up anomaly detection, New Relic starts analyzing the golden signals of your entities and workloads. Anomalies appear in your activity feeds throughout New Relic One and the Anomalies tab as soon as they’re detected. Click any anomaly to get more detail about it, including analysis and context for the anomaly. Tip For this limited release, anomaly detection won’t generate notifications. However, you can configure a NRQL alert condition for the NrAiAnomaly event. To view anomalies, from one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Issues & activity > Anomalies. Query anomaly data Detected anomalies are written to the NrAiAnomaly event in your NRDB account. You can learn more about this event and how to query it here. Reduce the number of detected anomalies If you’re seeing too many anomalies, the first step is to make sure your sensitivity level is set to Low. If it’s already set to Low, you can define specific thresholds to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. To define custom thresholds: From one.newrelic.com, go to Alerts & AI > Proactive Detection > Settings. Click the Custom tab and the configuration you want to modify. Select an entity or workload, and then change the sensitivity level. You can use custom sensitivity to define specific thresholds for different entity types.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for Alerts and Applied Intelligence. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string. Muting examples For more information about making requests to NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph documentation, including GraphQL tutorials.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string. Muting examples For more information about making requests to NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph documentation, including GraphQL tutorials.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string. Muting examples For more information about making requests to NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph documentation, including GraphQL tutorials. Fetch muting rules for account To fetch the list of muting rules (with name and condition) for an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { mutingRules { name condition { operator conditions { attribute operator values } } } } } } } Copy Create muting rule To create a muting rule and return the muting rule's id for muting violations from NRQL conditions where host facet is host-1: mutation { alertsMutingRuleCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { name: \"host-1 mute rule\", description: \"Mute host-1 violations\", enabled: true, condition: { operator: AND, conditions: [{ attribute: \"tags.host\", operator: EQUALS, values: [\"host-1\"] }] } }) { id } } Copy Create muting rule for specific hosts or products To create a muting rule and return the muting rule's id for muting violations from infrastructure conditions where the target host is host-1 or the violation was from synthetic or mobile monitoring: mutation { alertsMutingRuleCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { name: \"host-1 and synthetics/mobile mute rule\", description: \"Mute host-1 and synthetics/mobile violations\", enabled: true, condition: { operator: OR, conditions: [ { attribute: \"targetName\", operator: EQUALS, values: [\"host-1\"] }, { attribute: \"product\", operator: IN, values: [\"SYNTHETICS\", \"MOBILE\"] } ] } }) { id } } Copy Create a muting rule with a recurring schedule To create a muting rule scheduled to repeat with these criteria: Weekly on Tuesday and Friday End on 01/31/2021 Return the muting rule's schedule and id mutation { alertsMutingRuleCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { condition: { conditions: { attribute: \"conditionName\", operator: ANY, values: \"This is a condition\" }, operator: AND }, enabled: true, name: \"Recur Weekly\", schedule: { startTime: \"2020-12-01T12:00:00\", endTime: \"2020-12-01T14:00:00\", timeZone: \"America/Los_Angeles\", repeat: WEEKLY, endRepeat: \"2021-01-31T12:00:00\", weeklyRepeatDays: [TUESDAY, FRIDAY] } } ) { id schedule { endTime startTime timeZone repeat repeatCount endRepeat weeklyRepeatDays nextStartTime nextEndTime } } } Copy Rename and disable muting rule To change the name and disable a muting rule and return its new name: mutation { alertsMutingRuleUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: MUTING_RULE_ID, rule: { name: \"updated name\", enabled: false }) { name } } Copy Delete muting rule To delete a muting rule: mutation { alertsMutingRuleDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: MUTING_RULE_ID) { id } } Copy",

We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string. Muting examples For more information about making requests to NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph documentation, including GraphQL tutorials.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account.

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for synthetic monitoring Conditions for Multi-location synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string.

You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

These calls are for conditions with these types of entities: APM: Apps and key transactions Browser: Apps and key transactions Mobile: Mobile apps Exception: The following APM conditions are not available from this API endpoint: Conditions targeting labels (dynamic targeting) Web transaction percentile conditions Baseline conditions Important The API Explorer provides information about other types of conditions using separate endpoints, including external services (APM and mobile), and synthetic monitoring. Consider all types of alert conditions when searching or updating. If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create conditions for policies To add conditions to policies, include these values in the API call: Your user key The policy_id (available from API Explorer: Alerts Policies > GET > List) The required condition values in the API call (described in the API Explorer page and in the Alerts conditions API glossary) API Explorer: Alerts Conditions > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_conditions/policies/$POLICY_ID.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"condition\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\", \"enabled\": boolean, \"entities\": [ integer ], \"metric\": \"string\", \"gc_metric\": \"string\", \"condition_scope\": \"string\", \"violation_close_timer\": integer, \"runbook_url\": \"string\", \"terms\": [ { \"duration\": \"string\", \"operator\": \"string\", \"priority\": \"string\", \"threshold\": \"string\", \"time_function\": \"string\" } ], \"user_defined\": { \"metric\": \"string\", \"value_function\": \"string\" } } }' Copy The JSON response returns a condition id, which you will need to update or delete the condition.

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string.

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "Alerts sends out timely notifications when your system is having problems. Sometimes there are notifications you know you don't need to see. You can use muting rules to stop being bombarded by messages you don't want. Once you've spotted the common elements in your unwanted notifications, you can define muting rules that specifically target those elements, while letting other notifications through. Even when a notification is muted, Alerts still gathers data on those violations. Muting rules don't interfere with the alerts process and are applied at the point right before a notification is sent. Manage muting rules A muting rule condition is the set of individual expressions made up of attributes, operators, and values that define which violations to target for muting. You can create, enable, disable, and manage muting rules. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, and then click Muting rules. Enable or disable muting rules at any time. Rules can have one of the following statuses: Active: Muting is enabled and active. Scheduled: Muting is enabled but not active yet (there's a future schedule). Ended: Muting is enabled, but no longer active (there's no future schedule). Inactive: Muting is disabled. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Create a muting rule Tip Before creating muting rules, you'll need to create policies and conditions that generate violation notifications. To create a muting rule, click + Add a rule in the Muting rules screen. Enter a name and a description for the muting rule, and select the account to which the rule will apply. Next, build the violation filter. You can use a subset of violation event attributes (specifically accountId, conditionId, conditionName, entity.guid, nrqlEventType, nrqlQuery, policyId, policyName, runbookUrl (as conditionRunbookUrl), tags.<NAME>, and targetName) and sub-condition operators. Values can be compared against one of your violation attributes, such as an Alerts policy ID or a condition name. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Muting rules: You can create complex muting rules to target a small or large set of unwanted notifications. Schedule a muting rule If needed, you can schedule your muting rules. To do this, select a start time and/or end time. Optionally, you can set the muting rule to last an entire day. You can also choose to select a time zone for the muting rule schedule. The default is the time zone selected in your user preferences. Flexible and powerful options for scheduling your muting rules. You can schedule your muting rules to recur daily, weekly, or monthly. A muting rule that's scheduled to repeat weekly includes the option to select the days of the week to recur. If no days are selected, the weekly recurrence will default to repeating on the day of the week that the muting rule is scheduled to start. Important The Repeat day of the week checkboxes override the Starts and Ends date fields. If you set a start date and also choose a day of the week, your muting rules will be applied on the first of those days after your start date You can also specify when you would like recurrence to end by selecting either a specific date or a certain number of occurrences. Manage muting rules with NerdGraph In NerdGraph, you can use the following queries and mutations with your muting rules. You can see the schema in more detail in the API Explorer. actor.account.alerts.mutingRule: Fetch a muting rule by id. actor.account.alerts.mutingRules: Fetch a list of muting rules for an account. alertsMutingRuleCreate: Create a muting rule for an account. alertsMutingRuleUpdate: Update a muting rule by id and account id. alertsMutingRuleDelete: Delete a muting rule by id and account id. We've given you some sample queries and mutations examples in this document. A muting rule has the following fields and components: Muting rule Fields and components id The unique identifier for the muting rule. name (Required) A text field for the user-friendly name of the muting rule. This is used when listing or referencing a rule. We don't require that the name be unique, but it is recommended. description This is an optional text field describing the muting rule. It can be a useful way to provide more context for your muting rule. This data is only used for management display purposes. accountId The muting rule's account ID. A muting rule will only affect violations that occur in a single account. To mute violations across multiple accounts, you'll need to create a muting rule for each account separately. createdAt The timestamp when the muting rule was created (UTC). createdBy The user ID of the person who created the muting rule. updatedAt The timestamp when the muting rule was last modified (UTC). updatedBy The user ID of the person who last modified the muting rule. enabled Enable or disable the muting rule (Boolean). Muting rules must be manually enabled and disabled. condition The set of individual expressions that define which violations to target. A muting rule condition has: operator: The boolean operator AND or OR that defines how to combine the set of conditions. conditions: The set of individual expressions (sub-conditions) that target attributes within a violation. These are evaluated together based on the operator. You can have a maximum of 20 sub-conditions for a single muting rule. A sub-condition has: attribute: A single attribute within a violation. Go here for a list of Violation event attributes. operator: The comparison function used to compare the selected violation attribute against values in the condition. Go here for a list of sub-condition operators. values: An array of string values to compare against selected violation attributes. When the muting rules evaluate a condition, if necessary, values will be coerced from strings. You can use a maximum of 500 values when using an operator that supports comparison against multiple values, such as IN. schedule The time window when the MutingRule actively mutes violations. startTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule starts. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-08T14:30:00' endTime: The datetime stamp that represents when the muting rule ends. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-15T14:30:00' timeZone: The time zone that applies to the muting rule schedule. Example: 'America/Los_Angeles'. See Wikipedia's list of tz database time zones. repeat: The frequency the muting rule schedule repeats. If it does not repeat, use null. Options are DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY. endRepeat: The datetime stamp when the muting rule schedule stops repeating. This is in local ISO 8601 format without an offset. Example: '2020-07-10T15:00:00'. Note: Either endRepeat or repeatCount should be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. repeatCount: The number of times the muting rule schedule repeats. This includes the original schedule. For example, a repeatCount of 2 will recur one time. A repeatCount of 3 will recur two times. Note: Either repeatCount or endRepeat can be used to end a muting rule schedule. Both fields should not be provided together. weeklyRepeatDays: The day(s) of the week that a muting rule should repeat when the repeat field is set to 'WEEKLY'. Example: [ 'MONDAY', 'WEDNESDAY']. How muting rules work Muting rules are applied at the end of the default alert lifecycle in order to suppress, or mute, notifications. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. For example, you can mute notifications during known system disruptions, such as maintenance windows and deployments. System disruption violations will still be identified, even though the notifications for those violations are muted. A muting rule uses a set of conditions that match against attributes in a violation event. The muting rules tell us how to: Identify individual violations after they're created, but before an incident is opened. Override their default condition to indicate that they should be \"muted.\" Currently, muting a violation means that the normal Alerts incident lifecycle will be maintained, except that an incident that only contains muted violations will not send out any notifications. Muting rules override specific violations. They don't disable existing policies or conditions. This allows you to mute violations from specific entities that may be covered by a policy or condition that covers a large number of entities. This also keeps you from having to over-mute your monitoring when you are performing maintenance on a subset of your system. Muting behavior The following table describes how the Alerts incident lifecycle is affected by muted violations: IF AND THEN Event: Incident opens An incident opens because of a violation that is not muted An “Open incident” notification will be sent (default). An incident opens due to a violation that is muted An “Open incident” notification will not be sent (muted). Event: Violation added to an open incident A new muted violation is added to an already open incident No notification action is triggered (default). A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Open incident” notification will be sent. A new unmuted violation is added to an open incident An “Open incident” notification has already been sent No notification action is triggered (default). Event: Incident closed An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has not been sent A “Close incident” notification will not be sent. An Incident is closed An “Open incident” notification has been sent A “Close incident” notification will be sent. Event: Incident acknowledged An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has not been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will not be sent. An Incident is acknowledged An “Open incident” notification has been sent An “Incident acknowledged” notification will be sent. View muted violations and incidents When viewing an open or closed incident, violations and incidents are marked as Muted. The following sections show some of these muted violations and incidents, and where you can find them. An incident with a critical violation that's been muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Incidents. An incident that has been muted Violations and incidents are marked as Muted in the State column: Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Incidents, then click Open incidents. A list of violations, some of which are muted Go to one.newrelic.com, and in the top nav, click Alerts & AI, then click Events. A list of alert events, some of which are muted In the list of alert events, the State column shows which events have been muted. Go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, click Events, then click All events. Mute faceted results using tags. To mute results of faceted queries, use the tags.FACETED_ATTRIBUTE attribute, where FACETED_ATTRIBUTE represents the attributed you've run a NRQL FACET query on. For example: if your NRQL alert condition includes FACET host in its query, you can target that FACET attribute using tags.host. NRQL condition queries can accept multiple facet attributes. If you want to be able to filter from attributes in your events or metric time series that have been aggregated, you must add those attributes to your NRQL query FACET clause; for example: FACET host, region, cluster. For an example of using tags., see Create muting rule. Sub-condition operators The following are the logical operators available to use to compare attributes when you're constructing muting rules. For examples of these being used, see Examples. EQUALS: Where the supplied value equals the violation attribute value. NOT_EQUALS: Where the supplied value does not equal the violation attribute value. IN: Where the violation attribute value is present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). NOT_IN: Where the violation attribute value is not present in a list of supplied values (up to 500). CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is present in the violation attribute value. NOT_CONTAINS: Where the supplied value string is not present in the violation attribute value. ANY: Caution: A condition with this operator will mute all violations on the account. IS_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is blank. Null, empty string, etc. IS_NOT_BLANK: Where the violation attribute value is not blank. Null, empty string, etc. STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value begins with the supplied value string. NOT_STARTS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not begin with the supplied value string. ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value ends with the supplied value string. NOT_ENDS_WITH: Where the violation attribute value does not end with the supplied value string. Muting examples For more information about making requests to NerdGraph, see the NerdGraph documentation, including GraphQL tutorials. Fetch muting rules for account To fetch the list of muting rules (with name and condition) for an account: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { alerts { mutingRules { name condition { operator conditions { attribute operator values } } } } } } } Copy Create muting rule To create a muting rule and return the muting rule's id for muting violations from NRQL conditions where host facet is host-1: mutation { alertsMutingRuleCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { name: \"host-1 mute rule\", description: \"Mute host-1 violations\", enabled: true, condition: { operator: AND, conditions: [{ attribute: \"tags.host\", operator: EQUALS, values: [\"host-1\"] }] } }) { id } } Copy Create muting rule for specific hosts or products To create a muting rule and return the muting rule's id for muting violations from infrastructure conditions where the target host is host-1 or the violation was from synthetic or mobile monitoring: mutation { alertsMutingRuleCreate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { name: \"host-1 and synthetics/mobile mute rule\", description: \"Mute host-1 and synthetics/mobile violations\", enabled: true, condition: { operator: OR, conditions: [ { attribute: \"targetName\", operator: EQUALS, values: [\"host-1\"] }, { attribute: \"product\", operator: IN, values: [\"SYNTHETICS\", \"MOBILE\"] } ] } }) { id } } Copy Create a muting rule with a recurring schedule To create a muting rule scheduled to repeat with these criteria: Weekly on Tuesday and Friday End on 01/31/2021 Return the muting rule's schedule and id mutation { alertsMutingRuleCreate( accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, rule: { condition: { conditions: { attribute: \"conditionName\", operator: ANY, values: \"This is a condition\" }, operator: AND }, enabled: true, name: \"Recur Weekly\", schedule: { startTime: \"2020-12-01T12:00:00\", endTime: \"2020-12-01T14:00:00\", timeZone: \"America/Los_Angeles\", repeat: WEEKLY, endRepeat: \"2021-01-31T12:00:00\", weeklyRepeatDays: [TUESDAY, FRIDAY] } } ) { id schedule { endTime startTime timeZone repeat repeatCount endRepeat weeklyRepeatDays nextStartTime nextEndTime } } } Copy Rename and disable muting rule To change the name and disable a muting rule and return its new name: mutation { alertsMutingRuleUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: MUTING_RULE_ID, rule: { name: \"updated name\", enabled: false }) { name } } Copy Delete muting rule To delete a muting rule: mutation { alertsMutingRuleDelete(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: MUTING_RULE_ID) { id } } Copy",

      "body": "Over the course of several months during 2022, new functionalities in New Relic One will replace alerting functionalities reaching end of life (EOL). We are providing these early notices so you can plan accordingly and make a smooth transition. If you have questions or comments about anything in this EOL transition guide, don't hesitate to: Reach out to your New Relic account representative. Use the reply thread in our Explorers Hub post. What's changed Starting in late 2021, we've reorganized the navigation UI for alerts and applied intelligence. Although the alerts and applied intelligence navigation has changed pretty dramatically, all the features you use are still there. Instead of grouping things by features, we've reorganized the navigation into categories that clarify your alerts and applied intelligence workflow. For example, the Analyze category is the place where you can go to see all the recent activity for violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. We're slowly rolling out this update to all of our users over the next months. An overview of alerts and applied intelligence navigation changes The new UI includes these new categories. Analyze Use the analyze features to scan for critical problems affecting your systems, via alerts violations, issues, incidents, and anomalies. The overview page shows your most recent open, closed, and muted violations. The Issues & activity page shows your most recent issues, incidents, and anomalies. Detect Use the detect features to define the conditions in your system you want to be notified about, as well as configuring how anomalies are detected. The alert conditions (policies) page lists the policies where your conditions are created and organized. Create new policies here. The anomaly detection page lists your expanded anomaly detection configurations. An anomaly is a behavioral trend that doesn't match the historical data for your system. You can add or edit the configurations here. Correlate Use the correlate features to define your data sources and review and configure the logic grouping your incidents together. The sources page shows the data input sources you've chosen to analyze and be notified about. You can add new sources or configure existing ones. Sources include New Relic sources, such as alerts conditions and detected anomalies, as well as third-party sources like AWS Cloudwatch Alarms and PagerDuty. The decisions page shows your correlated incidents. You can review, edit, and add decisions. Enrich & notify Use the enrich and notify features to add additional metadata to your notifications, schedule when you don't want to be notified, and configure where your notifications get sent. Use the muting rules page to temporarily stop your alerts violation notifications. Use workflows to add more data to your alerts notifications. Use destinations to configure where your applied intelligence notifications get sent. Use pathways to configure where your correlated issues get sent. Use incident workflows to automate common problems and actions related to your alerts policies. Use incident destinations to add and configure third-party services for your incidents. Settings Use the settings page to review and manage your current incident intelligence usage. Alerts (classic) Alerts (classic) lets you manage events, incidents, and notification channels with the UI you're used to using. Use the events and incidents pages to review alerts violations and other events. Use the channels page for a list of your alerts notification channels and to create new channels. What's changing Here is a summary of what we plan to EOL in 2022, why this is happening, and what will replace the current experience for alerts and applied intelligence. February 2022: NRQL baselines to replace outlier NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Outlier conditions don't provide efficient cluster identification and analysis capabilities. Replacement: Use NRQL baselines to watch for anomalies in your cluster or to group similar signals. This method is an improvement over outlier conditions, since it will alert you to exactly which member of the group is misbehaving. You may be able to meet the same need as your old outlier conditions by using a faceted baseline condition. Learn more: Faceted baseline conditions documentation Explorers Hub May 2022: Sliding window aggregations to replace sum of query results thresholds. Reason for EOL: The NRQL sum of query results option has not been an ideal way to address issues caused by sporadic signals. It lacks the ability to smooth out volatile signals or efficiently deal with gaps in signal. Replacement: Development for full support for sliding window aggregation in NRQL conditions is underway. You can start using our current sliding windows functionality now. Learn more: Sliding window aggregation documentation Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Native experience in New Relic One to replace classic incident response workflow. Reason for EOL: The classic incident response workflow involves the Incident and Violation details pages in the UI. It also uses APIs for incidents and violations. Replacement: We will replace the current experience by rolling out improved incident response experiences with a new, native UI experience in New Relic One. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: Workflows and destinations to replace notification channels and relationship to policies. Reason for EOL: The current alerting setup process is rigid and cannot be customized. It also requires restrictive policy-based alert conditions that focus on incident creation. Replacement: Workflows and destinations, a new way to manage issue-driven notifications, will replace current notification channel options. This solution is more flexible, and it enables notifications for all severity levels. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided for the new workflow. Explorers Hub 2nd half of 2022: NRQL conditions to replace all non-NRQL alert condition types. Reason for EOL: Currently NRQL alert conditions are one type of alert condition we offer. But our many types of alert conditions have resulted in a complex user experience, and the lack of alignment has prevented advances in detection capabilities. Replacement: This is being replaced by NRQL alert conditions with increased functionality. You can start preparing for this transition now by using NRQL alert conditions instead of other types. Learn more: Additional documentation will be provided. Explorers Hub",

      "body": "For some types of conditions, you can define a custom violation description that passes useful information downstream for better violation responses or for use by other systems. You can create a custom violation description in the UI or with NRQL. Requirements The custom violation description feature is available for: NRQL alert conditions Infrastructure monitoring alert conditions The custom violation description field has a maximum character size of 4000. What is a custom violation description? For some types of conditions, you can create a custom violation description that passes information about a condition and its violations downstream. Using a description, you can: Capture the reason for the condition Define the signal being monitored Define next steps Add metadata to downstream systems The Custom violation description field allows you to use a general template structure that, when a violation is generated, substitutes the generic sections with specific values. For example, let's say you used this in a description: This is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Copy A violation resulting from this condition would fill in the details and you'd receive a notification like this: This is my condition name : My Great Alert Condition The hostname is : ip-123-45-67-89.us-west-1.compute.internal Copy Create a custom violation description In the one.newrelic.com top nav, click Alerts & AI, click Alert policies, (select a policy), then (select a condition): Click + Add custom violation description to open the field. You can create a custom violation description using the dedicated field for NRQL alerts, or the Describe this condition section for infrastructure alerts. Custom violation description template example Here's a custom violation description template example: this is my condition name : {{conditionName}} The hostname is : {{tags.fullHostname}} Owning Team: {{tags.label.owning_team}} Product: {{tags.label.product}} ec2VpcId: {{tags.aws.ec2VpcId}} Service name : {{tags.label.Name}} AWS Region : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} AWS Availability Zone: {{tags.aws.awsAvailabilityZone}} Department : {{tags.label.department}} Environment: {{tags.label.environment}} Cluster: {{tags.clusterName}} Cluster Role: {{tags.clusterRole}} EC2 Instance Type: {{tags.instanceType}} EC2 InstanceID: {{tags.aws.ec2InstanceId}} EC2 AmiId: {{tags.aws.ec2AmiId}} EC2 Root Device Type: {{tags.aws.ec2RootDeviceType}} Copy Here's how that data might appear in a notification: How to use attributes The attributes you can use in a custom violation description are a subset of attributes attached to the violation event. Here are some details about the available attributes and how to use them: Violation event attributes: For any of the standard attributes available for use in a custom violation description, use the format {{AN_ATTRIBUTE}}. For example: The target name is : {{targetName}} Copy Tag attributes: For tags, you would use the format {{tags.TAG_NAME}}. There are two types of tags: Entity-related tags: For Infrastructure conditions only. You can find available entity-related tags by going to the New Relic Explorer and looking under a service's Metadata and tags, or by viewing violation details. Here's an example of using tags in a custom violation description: The AWS region is : {{tags.aws.awsRegion}} Responsible team : {{tags.label.owning_team}} Copy Facet clause tags: For NRQL conditions only. If a NRQL condition uses a FACET clause, you can use tags formatting to use those values in your custom violation description. For example, if the NRQL query included FACET hostName, cluster, you could then use this: The host is : {{tags.hostName}} The cluster is : {{tags.cluster}} Copy Please note that tag names cannot include whitespace. The expanded values can include whitespace, but not the names of the tags themselves. Create a custom violation description with NRQL You can create a custom violation description using a NRQL alert condition by creating a mutation with a description. Here's an empty mutation template: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, id: \"YOUR_CONDITION_ID\", condition: {description: \"\"}) { YOUR_CUSTOM_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION } } Copy Here's an example mutation with a custom violation description: mutation { alertsNrqlConditionStaticUpdate(accountId: 123456, id: \"123456\", condition: {description: \"timestamp : {{timestamp}} \\n accountId : {{accountId}} \\n type : {{type}} \\n event : {{event}} \\n description : {{description}} \\n policyId : {{policyId}} \\n policyName: {{policyName}} \\n conditionName : {{conditionName}} \\n conditionId : {{conditionId}} \\n product : {{product}} \\n conditionType : {{conditionType}} \\n RunbookUrl : {{runbookUrl}} \\n nrqlQuery : {{nrqlQuery}} \\n nrqlEventType : {{nrqlEventType}} \\n targetID : {{targetId}} \\n targetName : {{targetName}} \\n commandLine : {{tags.commandLine}} \\n entityGuid : {{tags.entityGuid}} \\n entityName : {{tags.entityName}} \\n fullHostname : {{tags.fullHostname}} \\n instanceType : {{tags.instanceType}} \\n processDisplayName : {{tags.processDisplayName}}\"}) { description } } Copy For more information on NRQL conditions and using the NerdGraph API, go to NerdGraph API: NRQL condition alerts. For Infrastructure monitoring conditions, you can create the custom violation description when creating an Infrastructure monitoring alert condition. To learn about how to structure a custom violation description, see the example template and the attribute/tag instructions. Mentioning users or notifying channel in Slack When creating a description that you know will be sent to Slack, you may wish to @mention a user or generate a channel-wide notification (for example, @here or @channel). To achieve this, simply include the User ID or a channel-wide notification in the description surrounded by < and > characters. Here's an example for mentioning a user: Attention <@LewCirne> Copy Here's an example for generating a channel-wide notification: Attention <!channel> Copy Important Note that the Slack convention for channel-wide notifications in Incoming Webhooks is to use a ! prefix instead of @. For example, !here or !channel.",
