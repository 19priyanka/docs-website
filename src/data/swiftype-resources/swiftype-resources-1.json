      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Child accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic. View or change current subscription To view or change your current subscription options: From the account dropdown, select Upgrade subscription/Change subscription. OR From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Subscription. Options include: Upgrade or downgrade your pricing and subscription levels Cancel your subscription or delete your account Change your account's tax location for billing purposes If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department.

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Optional: Downgrade some users to basic New Relic users provisioned via an identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles.

Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature creates users on our New Relic One user model. To implement AUM, you must be on our New Relic One user model and have user management roles assigned. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Set up automated user management (AUM) For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: In the authentication domain UI, enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. Configure SAML SSO. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll likely want to downgrade some of your billable full users to free basic users. To do this, use the User management UI.

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5.

Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Optional: Downgrade some users to basic New Relic users provisioned via an identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature creates users on our New Relic One user model. To implement AUM, you must be on our New Relic One user model and have user management roles assigned. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Set up automated user management (AUM) For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: In the authentication domain UI, enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. Configure SAML SSO. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll likely want to downgrade some of your billable full users to free basic users. To do this, use the User management UI. Once your users are provisioned in New Relic, you'll need to assign access grants to give them access to accounts. Learn more about access grants. Recommended: Set a time zone in your identity provider. If not specified, our UI shows date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\").

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5.

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Optional: Downgrade some users to basic New Relic users provisioned via an identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles.

From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7.

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read our AUM requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Optional: Downgrade some users to basic New Relic users provisioned via an identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

Once this automated provisioning is complete, your users can log in to New Relic via their identity provider. Requirements Requirements and impacts: Requires Enterprise edition. User model-related requirements: This feature creates users on our New Relic One user model. To implement AUM, you must be on our New Relic One user model and have user management roles assigned. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. Supported identity providers: Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin. For unsupported identity providers, we have a SCIM API. Notes on initial enabling of AUM: We don't currently support toggling SCIM on or off. If an authentication domain has already been set up with the source of users as Manual, you can't change it to SCIM. When first enabled, the bearer token is generated and only shown once. If you need to view a bearer token later, the only way to do this is to generate a new one, and that will invalidate the old one and any integrations using the old token. Set up automated user management (AUM) For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: In the authentication domain UI, enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. Configure SAML SSO. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll likely want to downgrade some of your billable full users to free basic users. To do this, use the User management UI. Once your users are provisioned in New Relic, you'll need to assign access grants to give them access to accounts. Learn more about access grants. Recommended: Set a time zone in your identity provider. If not specified, our UI shows date/times with the UTC time zone. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\").

From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users.

Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration. Check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Step 4. Assign users and groups Next, you'll assign users in Okta's New Relic application. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. Assignments tab In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Optional: in the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Members without a time zone configured, will use the group time zone. Time zone affects how date/times are shown in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (e.g., \"America/Los_Angeles\"). Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Optional: Downgrade some users to basic New Relic users provisioned via an identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Child accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic. View or change current subscription To view or change your current subscription options: From the account dropdown, select Upgrade subscription/Change subscription. OR From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Subscription. Options include: Upgrade or downgrade your pricing and subscription levels Cancel your subscription or delete your account Change your account's tax location for billing purposes If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department.

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

With Partner accounts, authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. For accounts where the partnership supports SSO, users may access their New Relic UI without reauthenticating. These Partner accounts could use SAML SSO as an alternative secure method to sign in to the New Relic site. Other Partner accounts, including Heroku, AppDirect, and Microsoft Azure, do not permit direct login to New Relic. In this situation, SAML integration from the partner's site is not supported by the partner SSO. If you have questions, contact your partner representative at New Relic. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Example Your account structure and settings affect whether SAML is available and how it applies to your accounts. This example shows the hierarchy for New Relic Partner accounts with parent accounts and child accounts. Here is an example of how accounts and child accounts inherit the SAML SSO configuration. Account level SAML SSO configuration Partnership The partnership level allows you to control whether accounts under the partnership can have SAML enabled. The partnership account's Owner has certain administrative functions, but a SAML configuration on this account is not inherited by other accounts in the partnership. Parent accounts Parent accounts (also referred to as master accounts) have a direct, hierarchical relationship to one or more child accounts. Typically the SAML configuration on a parent account is inherited automatically by all of its child accounts. Child accounts Child accounts (also known as sub-accounts) inherit their SAML SSO configuration from their parent account when the parent account has SAML configured. If the parent account does not have SAML configured, each child account may have its own configuration. For more information, see Configuring SAML with multiple accounts.",

Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users for New Relic accounts with SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email.

Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization.

After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic SSO settings UI page: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. As an additional security measure for SAML single sign-on (SSO) accounts, users are not added until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. Users in the pending state (not yet confirmed) won't receive notifications, such as alerts. For accounts without SAML SSO integration, the account Owner and Admins can add new users without requiring confirmation. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Add and confirm users Follow this process to add and confirm users for New Relic accounts with SAML SSO: The account's Owner or an Administrator adds new users: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Summary. On SAML-enabled accounts, New Relic flags the users as Pending and sends an email confirmation. (Pending users will not receive notifications associated with their user role, such as alert notifications.) Users select the link in the email to confirm their account, which directs them to the SAML provider's login URL. When users successfully sign into their SAML SSO end point (Auth0, Okta, OneLogin, Ping Identity, Salesforce, etc.), New Relic flags the users as Active. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Admin user's API keys for all users that go into a pending state will be deleted. Bypass email confirmation Depending on your subscription level, you may have the option to claim the domain names that you own and bypass the SAML SSO confirmation process. When the account Owner or Administrators add new users and their email address has a domain that matches the account's domains, New Relic automatically adds them as Active users. Benefits of identifying domain ownership include: Adds a useful feature to your account. Claims domains as your own. Makes it easier for your employees to get started with New Relic, because they do not need to confirm their account access. Maintains security when adding users outside of your organization. To flag your account as owning one or more domain names, get support at support.newrelic.com.",

If you have used your password reset link but are not redirected to the password reset page, troubleshoot the following: Your password reset link has expired. You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

If you have used your password reset link but are not redirected to the password reset page, troubleshoot the following: Your password reset link has expired. You will need to request a new link from the New Relic website. You are experiencing a caching issue. Clear your browsing cache or use a private browsing window before trying the link again. Tip Private browsing, also known as incognito mode, is a privacy feature to disable browsing history and the web cache. To open a private browsing window, you can use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+Shift+N on Windows and Command+Shift+N on Mac for most browsing applications. If this still doesn't solve your problem, get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Asked to verify email during login. If your email is associated with multiple accounts, you will be given the option to verify your email during login. This will allow you to choose which account to access. If you do not verify your email address, New Relic will attempt to log you in with the most recently created user record associated with your email address. To avoid verifying your email during each login, click the Remember Me checkbox in the login screen. General system solutions Some general system problems and solutions: Delete an account you recently created. If you created a New Relic account unnecessarily and want to delete it, and if that account is a simple one, you may be able to delete it yourself. See Delete simple organization. SAML single sign-on (SSO) problems prevent login. If your organization uses a SAML Single Sign On (SSO) solution, you can skip the Password field when you log in. If you need to reset your password, contact your organization's system administrator or IT department as applicable. If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account. With partner accounts, SAML SSO authentication to sign in to New Relic is controlled by the partnership. Depending on the partnership, you may or may not be able to log in directly to New Relic.",

If you're an administrator who has recently enabled or made changes to your SAML SSO settings and are unable to log in, there might be an issue with your configuration. Customers on the New Relic One user model can use a special recovery flow to fix any issues. Visit login.newrelic.com/recovery_access to bypass SSO and gain one-time access to your organization. System failure errors prevent login. If you receive failure errors while trying to sign up, a third-party password manager may be triggering New Relic's spam trap. To work around this, try these solutions: Bypass your password manager. Use a different browser to sign up with New Relic. Get support at support.newrelic.com, or send an email to account_recovery@newrelic.com. Mobile device solutions If you are unable to log in from your mobile device, the new user authentication time frame may have expired. You must complete this process within 20 minutes of receiving New Relic's confirmation message for your mobile device. To solve this problem, request another confirmation message to be sent to your device. Also, depending on your New Relic account, additional installation or authentication steps may be required for your iOS or Android app account. Solutions for other situations Here are suggestions for other unique situations. Unable to log in from your New Relic partner account.

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and you want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Assign users access to accounts (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

Limits If your organization has a parent/child account structure, child accounts do not inherit a parent account's alert policies: You must create policies separately for all child accounts. The following rules apply both to the New Relic One user interface and to the REST API (v2). New Relic Alerts Minimum value Maximum value Alert policies: Alert policy name 1 character 64 characters Policies per account n/a 10000 policies Products per policy any New Relic product (APM, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitoring, etc.) any New Relic product Alert conditions: Condition name 1 character 128 characters Conditions per policy 0 conditions 500 conditions Infrastructure alert conditions 0 conditions 3700 conditions NRQL query conditions OR Web app response percentiles per account 0 conditions 4000 conditions Targets (product entities) per condition 1 target 1000 targets from 1 or more products Thresholds per condition 0 Warnings, 1 Critical 1 Warning, 1 Critical Alert violations: Custom violation descriptions 4000 characters Duration for condition violation 5 minutes Exception: 1 minute for at least once conditions, because the violation could occur during the first minute (or any minute). 2 hours Violations per incident 1 violation 10,000 violations Violations beyond this limit will not be persisted.

The original account/user model will be increasingly deprecated as more New Relic customers are migrated to the new model. Important Note that the account/user model is not directly related to our two different pricing plans. Here are some important aspects of the original account/user model and links to important docs: Our original user model did not have firm boundaries between organizations/customers, and was much more user-centric. This meant that a user could be granted access to data from different organizations, and could access that data from a single login. Read more about the differences between the old and new model. On the original user model, a user’s access to accounts is based on: a) being added to a specific account, or b) having access to a parent account and inheriting access to that account’s child accounts.

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a UI for understanding your New Relic usage and managing your data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. But to get more detail, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should set the Evaluation offset value to 60 minutes or your conditions may not trigger. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple sub-accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_SUB-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations.

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Tip To use our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, defined as users with access to Full Stack Observability features. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. Users with duplicate email addresses are only counted once. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original account/user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account, and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

      "body": "This tutorial will walk you through some common procedures for managing users on the New Relic One user model. Requirements Some notes on who this tutorial is for and requirements: This tutorial is for managing users on our New Relic One user model. Assigning new group access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we first recommend reading these docs: Where to find user management features in the UI Important user management concepts This tutorial will walk you through how to: View available accounts How to grant groups access to roles and accounts How to create custom roles How to add users to groups View available accounts Understanding the accounts in your New Relic organization is important for granting groups access, because you must choose what accounts to grant them access to. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant groups access to roles and accounts Groups are used to manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. By default, organizations on the New Relic One account/user structure have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you have the ability to create new groups and new roles, and to assign groups to other accounts in your organization. Tip Note that you can also import users from your identity provider. To view existing group access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. To grant a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. Complete the UI prompts to assign an existing group or a new group access to a specific role on a specific account. If you have questions about these concepts, see User management concepts. Optional: To give a group the ability to manage other users, under Scope, select Organization and choose the Authentication domain manager role. For more on the difference between organization- and account-scoped roles, see Standard roles. (Note that these users must also have an account-scoped role. Without that, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Optional: to continue adding access for the same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. Some important tips to understand when managing groups: If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. When you create a new group, note that your users don't have access to that group until both of these steps are done: 1) The group has been granted access, and 2) Users have been added to that group. Create custom role When granting a group access to roles and accounts, you can use our default standard roles that have default capabilities, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Note that there are some hidden capabilities that are not available for adding to a custom role. For details, see Capabilities. To learn more about how roles and groups relate, see User management concepts. Add users If you've created a new group, you must make sure that the users are added to that group. If users don't have the group assigned, no access will be granted. To view or manage users: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and you want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Assign users access to accounts (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

      "body": "Our automated user management (AUM) allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Downgrade some users to basic When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you should be able to see them in the User management UI. Users provisioned via your identity provider start out as full users. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, these users are billable. To convert users to free basic users, use the User management UI. Step 6. Assign access grants Once your users are in New Relic, you need to grant them access to specific New Relic accounts, specific groups, and specific roles. Without doing this, your users have no access to New Relic accounts. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved account/user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, and users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-model organizations that meet requirements can use a migration wizard to convert their users to the new model. When the migration process is complete, your users will be on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Before using the user migration wizard, please review the guidelines below. The wizard is aimed at migrating users for fairly simple New Relic organizations. We'll continue to add to the user migration features so that it works better for more complex organizations. Requirements and guidelines: You must have the Owner role to start using the user migration wizard. If your organization has more than 20 accounts, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If your organization has a fairly complex parent/child-account structure, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. If you frequently add accounts to your organization, we recommend not using the wizard at this point in time. Currently, with the new model, you must get New Relic assistance to add accounts. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) are currently applied for an entire organization and can't be assigned at the account level. If you require account-level user management role assignment, we recommend not using the wizard. If you were previously using OneLogin, Azure, or Okta apps for a New Relic integration, note that you'll likely need a different, newer app titled \"New Relic by organization\" (and not \"New Relic by account\"). If you don't meet these requirements but still want to migrate your users in order to take advantage of the new model benefits, contact your New Relic account representative. Understand basic user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users complete access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or AUM-implemented SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or AUM today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer account/user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer account/user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original account/user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original account/user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets, such as dashboards and favorites, are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. If a user has access to several organizations (for example, if that user is a contractor), the user won't be fully deleted until all organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will find themselves with both the original user record and new user records (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more).

For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and you want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Assign users access to accounts (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

Requirements Some notes on who this tutorial is for and requirements: This tutorial is for managing users on our New Relic One user model. Assigning new group access grants requires Pro or Enterprise edition. For details, see user management requirements. Role requirements: Using the Organization and access UI to manage group access requires Authentication domain manager and Organization manager roles. Using the User management UI to add/edit users requires Authentication domain manager role. Overview Before using this tutorial, we first recommend reading these docs: Where to find user management features in the UI Important user management concepts This tutorial will walk you through how to: View available accounts How to grant groups access to roles and accounts How to create custom roles How to add users to groups View available accounts Understanding the accounts in your New Relic organization is important for granting groups access, because you must choose what accounts to grant them access to. To view the accounts in your organization: go to the account dropdown, click Administration, click Organizations and access, and then click Accounts. Grant groups access to roles and accounts Groups are used to manage what your users are able to do in New Relic. By default, organizations on the New Relic One account/user structure have two available groups: Admin and User. These default groups automatically have access to specific standard roles and are assigned to the account in which they were initially added. If you have Pro or Enterprise edition, you have the ability to create new groups and new roles, and to assign groups to other accounts in your organization. Tip Note that you can also import users from your identity provider. To view existing group access grants: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and then click Organization and access. To grant a user group access to a role and an account: From the Organization and access UI, click Group access. Complete the UI prompts to assign an existing group or a new group access to a specific role on a specific account. If you have questions about these concepts, see User management concepts. Optional: To give a group the ability to manage other users, under Scope, select Organization and choose the Authentication domain manager role. For more on the difference between organization- and account-scoped roles, see Standard roles. (Note that these users must also have an account-scoped role. Without that, you may see a message that the user doesn't belong to an organization.) Optional: to continue adding access for the same group, select Add another at the bottom before clicking Add access. Some important tips to understand when managing groups: If a group has basic users in it, their basic user status overrides any group-related restrictions. When you create a new group, note that your users don't have access to that group until both of these steps are done: 1) The group has been granted access, and 2) Users have been added to that group. Create custom role When granting a group access to roles and accounts, you can use our default standard roles that have default capabilities, or you can create your own roles with unique sets of capabilities. To view existing roles: from the account dropdown, click Administration, then click Organization and access, and then click Roles. To create a custom role, click Add new custom role. Note that there are some hidden capabilities that are not available for adding to a custom role. For details, see Capabilities. To learn more about how roles and groups relate, see User management concepts. Add users If you've created a new group, you must make sure that the users are added to that group. If users don't have the group assigned, no access will be granted. To view or manage users: from the account dropdown, click Administration, and click User management. If you don’t see that option, review the requirements. Groups reside within the boundaries of an authentication domain. If your organization has more than one authentication domain, the domain switcher in the top left will show which one you’re in. To add a user, click Add user. Complete the prompts in the UI, including choosing the user type and group. Any custom groups you’ve added should be available from the group dropdown. If the custom group you choose has been granted access to a role and an account, once you add the user to that group, that user will now have access. To edit a user’s group or other details: click on the user you want to edit and make changes.",

Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and you want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Assign users access to accounts (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Learn about user models. To manage their users, New Relic organizations can configure one or more authentication domains, which control how users are added to a New Relic account, how they’re authenticated, and more. Requirements To check if you have access to these features, you can go to the authentication domain settings UI and see if you can configure settings. Requirements to configure these settings: These features are for managing users on the New Relic One user model. For users on our original user model, see Original account management. Configuring these settings requires Pro or Enterprise edition. To edit these settings, you must be in a group with the Authentication domain manager role. SCIM provisioning, also known as automated user management, requires Enterprise tier. SAML SSO requires Pro or Enterprise edition. SAML support includes: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 What is an authentication domain? An \"authentication domain\" is a grouping of New Relic users governed by the same user management settings, like how they're provisioned (added and updated), how they're authenticated (logged in), session settings, and how user upgrades are managed. When someone creates a New Relic account, the default authentication settings are: Users are manually added to New Relic Users manually log in using their email and password Those default settings would be under one \"authentication domain.\" Another authentication domain might be set up like this: Users are added and managed from an identity provider using SCIM provisioning Users are logged in using SAML single sign-on (SSO) from an identity provider When you add users to New Relic, they’re added to a specific authentication domain. Typically organizations have either one or two authentication domains: one for the manual, default methods and one for the methods associated with an identity provider. Create and configure an authentication domain If you meet the requirements, you can add and manage authentication domains. To view and configure authentication domains: from the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you have existing domains, they'll be on the left. Note that most organizations have, at most, two domains: one with the manual, default settings and one for the identity provider-related settings. To create a new domain from the authentication domain UI page, click Create new. For more about the configuration options, keep reading. Source of users: Manual versus SCIM (AUM) Tip Before configuring SCIM, please read our AUM docs. From the authentication domain UI, you can set one of two options for how users are added to New Relic: Manual: This means that your users are added manually to New Relic from the User management UI. SCIM: Our automated user management (AUM) feature allows you to use SCIM provisioning to import and manage users from your identity provider. For instructions, see Automated user management. Authentication The authentication method is the way in which New Relic users log in to New Relic. All users in an authentication domain have a single authentication method. There are two authentication options: Username/password: Your users log in via email and password. SAML SSO: Your users log in via SAML single sign-on (SSO) via your identity provider. To learn how to set that up, keep reading. Set up SAML SSO authentication Tip Recommended: first read the requirements. Note that how you enable SAML SSO differs depending on the identity provider you use, and whether you're also configuring SAML. Enabling SAML may also require you to read your identity provider docs. If you're setting up SCIM provisioning: If you use Azure, Okta, or OneLogin, follow these procedures first: Azure | OneLogin | Okta. If you use a different identity provider, follow the SAML procedures below and use our SCIM API to enable SCIM. If you only want to enable SAML SSO and not SCIM, and if you use Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, follow these instructions for configuring the relevant app: Azure app Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your list of applications. Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Okta app Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your Okta applications. Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Add Application. In the search field on the Okta Add applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. OneLogin app Add the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to your OneLogin applications. Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add app. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by organization page, click on Save. If you're implementing SAML using a different identity provider not mentioned above, you'll need to attempt to integrate using the SAML instructions below. Note that your identity provider must use the SAML 2.0 protocol, and must require signed SAML assertions. Next, you'll go to our authentication domain UI. From the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new domain to be used for your SAML-authenticating users. Under Authentication, click Configure. Under Method of authenticating users, select SAML SSO. If you're using the Okta, OneLogin, or Azure AD app, you can skip this step. Under Provided by New Relic, we have some New Relic-specific information. You'll need to place these in the relevant fields in your identity provider service. If you're not sure where they go, consult your identity provider docs. Under Provided by you, input the Source of SAML metadata. This URL is supplied by your identity provider and may be called something else. It should conform to SAML V2.0 metadata standards. If your identity provider doesn't support dynamic configuration, you can do this by using Upload a certificate. This should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate. Under Provided by you, set the SSO target URL supplied by your identity provider. You can find this by going to the Source of SAML metadata and finding the POST binding URL. It looks like: https://newrelic.oktapreview.com/app/newreliclr/1234567890abcdefghij/sso/saml. If your identity provider has a redirect URL for logout, enter it in the Logout redirect URL; otherwise, leave it blank. If you’re using an identity provider app, you’ll need to input the authentication domain ID in the app. That ID is found at the top of New Relic’s authentication domain UI page. Optional: In New Relic’s authentication domain UI, you can adjust other settings, like browser session length and user upgrade method. You can adjust these settings at any time. If you're enabling SAML only, you need to create groups and assign access grants in New Relic. (If you enabled SCIM, you've already completed this step.) Access grants are what give your users access to New Relic accounts. Without access grants, your users are provisioned in New Relic but have no account access. To learn how to do this: Learn how access grants work Read the access grant tutorial. Okta only: Return to Okta's New Relic app and, from the Add New Relic by organization page, uncheck the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. To verify it's been set up correctly, see if your users can log in to New Relic via your identity provider and ensure they have access to their accounts. Session duration and timeout At the bottom of the authentication domain UI, you can control some other settings for the users in that domain, including: Length of time users can remain logged in. Amount of idle time before a user's session expires. User upgrade requests User upgrade requests At the bottom of the authentication domain UI, one of the settings is controlling how basic users upgrade to billable full users. You have two choices: Allow basic users to self-upgrade, which allows basic users to be able to quickly upgrade in order to respond to issues. Require review by admins (users with the Authentication domain manager role). With this setting, admins receive an email when an upgrade request is made, and can manage requests in the User management UI. For more about basic users and full users, see User type. Note that if you're on our original user model, upgrades work differently.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced query builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating browser, mobile, and synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's query builder or the GraphQL API. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use query builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "New Relic Lookout provides visibility into your entire estate. It doesn't require any configuration — you can query anything in your estate that matters to you right now and understand your system as a whole, or dive deep into causes and effects, so you can quickly get the data you need to take action. Know exactly where to focus your attention with New Relic Lookout. The brighter the color, the more severe the change, and the bigger the size, the bigger the scale. Then dig deeper with correlations and abnormal history to see how it impacts your whole system—no configuration needed. Why it matters New Relic Lookout helps software teams of any size discover potential issues before they have an impact. Fill gaps in monitoring with full coverage out-of-the-box, no configuration or setup required. Immediately see anything deviating from normal across your entire estate. Proactively spot emerging problems in a real-time visualization of all system components. Gain faster incidents resolution through automatically surfaced causes and effects. Analyze any data in New Relic database (NRDB), including third-party, open, and custom data. Launch into other areas of New Relic One for deeper understanding Requirements New Relic Lookout requires Pro or Enterprise edition. If you are on Standard edition, you can still use the New Relic Lookout view in the New Relic Explorer. If you want to see data spanning 13-months, correlations, profiles, traces, and other details, you must upgrade to a higher edition. Get started with New Relic Lookout To access New Relic Lookout, click the Apps button in New Relic One and locate the New Relic Lookout launcher. You can also access New Relic Lookout directly from the New Relic One header bar, via the More dropdown. Enablement of key service performance indicator data is required for New Relic Lookout to provide value from the data you already have. The default view provides insight into three key Service performance indicators broken down by application: throughput, response time, and errors. These metrics are analyzed to show how the data has behaved during the last five minutes compared to the prior hour. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: Anything that significantly deviates from the trend is automatically discovered by New Relic Lookout, which doesn't require any configuration. Circle visualization and table view Each application (or other facet) is represented by a circle. The size of the circles indicate the magnitude of the signal for that application and the color indicates whether the value has significantly decreased or increased in the last five minutes, based on the standard deviation of the prior hour (default evaluation and comparison time windows.) Please note that the type of signal is important when interpreting your results. When you first look at the legend below, you might be tempted to interpret yellow as good and dark purple as bad, but that is not always the case. Here are some examples: In the APM/services golden signals, a dark yellow circle in Throughput might signify that something bad has occurred and led to a drop in traffic. At the same time, a dark purple circle might also be concerning due to unexpected load. Both are significant findings worth exploring. In browser golden signals, a dark purple circle in Page Views might be great, as you are seeing more traffic to your site! With errors golden signals (in all entity types), a large circle, even if gray (not deviating from normal volume), is worth exploring because a high count of errors in your system is important to investigate. The legend allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services To change the color palette, click the gear icon by the low-high color legend. This allows you to change the colors used to highlight deviating services. To get a table view of the same data, click the toggle on the right. You can also hover over each color to filter the view by degree lower or higher deviance. Abnormal golden signals On the right, New Relic Lookout displays the most significantly deviating applications (or other facet) in a side panel, weighted by both the magnitude of the performance indicators and the scale of their deviations. Details include the name of the key performance indicator, their magnitude during the recent time window, and the difference between the averages from one time compared to the other. Instant search Click the magnifying glass icon in the side panel to open a search box. Typing into the search box filters the circles, table, and abnormal signals to applications (or other facets) that contain the text. This is a good way to quickly zoom to various subsystems. New Relic Lookout doesn't rerun the analysis when using the instant search. Change view Click the Change View button on the right side panel. The panel that appears shows you all the entity-specific golden signals you can toggle between out of the box. By choosing the Browser Golden Signal or other views, you can change from the default view. Each new view will have the golden signals appropriate for that entity type. Drill down into the details To analyze an application or facet, click a circle, table row, or abnormal golden signal. The details panel shows the degree of deviation of the performance indicator, a link to the affected entity, and recent alert and deployment activity for that entity, when available. There’s also an indication of whether the selected evaluation time period would be abnormal or not in reference to other comparison time windows, such as the same time yesterday or the same time last week. This allows you to quickly see if the abnormal behavior is odd in general, or just based on the comparison time window. Performance tab The default tab shows charts for other key performance indicators for the selected application or facet. The charts compare the two time windows being analyzed. You can click their titles to rerun the analysis, focusing on the selected key performance indicator. When the target is a New Relic One application, we show the top transactions, error classes, external services, and database operations, alongside links to the relevant New Relic One features. Abnormal History tab This section analyzes past performance of the selected signal and calls out any time periods with notable abnormalities. Each card represents an abnormal time window and can be clicked for more details. The charts will display any relevant violations and deployments in New Relic. Correlations tab New Relic Lookout can find other signals that began behaving differently around the same time as the selected signal for that entity type. Clicking the name of the signal reruns the analysis, focusing on that key performance indicator. The chart titles link to New Relic One when there’s an associated entity in your account. Note that correlations currently do not analyze across accounts. The correlated signals displayed are for others in the account of the original application you are viewing. This helps focus the data on correlations that are more likely related to your issue. Profile tab Based on the same technology as New Relic’s error profiles, this tab compares the last five minutes to the prior hour by default (or whatever time windows you’ve selected with query editing) and surfaces any attributes that have significantly different distributions in the events being targeted by the selected signal. For example, if a custom attribute indicated that a recent throughput spike came from one user, that would surface highly in Profiles if most of the traffic usually comes from many users. Traces tab If the entity has distributed traces configured and available in the selected evaluated time window, the Traces section is enabled. Each card shows a summary of a trace and can be clicked for details. The Explore all traces links to the distributed traces application, filtered to the selected entity. Create a custom view To target signals and time windows beyond the default values, click the Change view button and select Custom view. To create your own view: Select the account or subaccount. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. In View a chart with, select the metric or event you are interested in. Default is golden signals (throughput, response time, and errors). You can also build custom queries (filters) to target a signal that isn't on the list. In Facet by, select what the circles represent. Default is appName, but you can also choose host or any other facetable attribute available for the signal you’ve selected. If you plan to save/favorite this new view, provide a name in the Name your view box. Keep in mind that you can edit this view at any time using the pencil icon. The default time windows analyzed by New Relic Lookout are the last five minutes compared to the hour before. Use the time controls (View data from and Compare data to) to target other time windows. one.newrelic.com > Apps > New Relic Lookout: All event and metric data in the New Relic database can be queried using the Edit query feature. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. You can also create your own query: Create your query. This query is comparing data from the past thirty minutes to data from the same range a day ago. Change from Basic to Advanced after clicking the Custom view button. Select the data type (metrics or events). Different functionality is available depending on the type. Enter your query using NRQL. Please note that not all NRQL features are available in the Lookout Advanced query feature. By default, the system will run this query using the last five minutes of data compared to the previous hour. Some examples of the syntax for changing the comparison and evaluation time windows are below. Click Analyze to begin analyzing the signal you’ve selected. Query: Compare the last 15 minutes to the same time 1 day ago Please note that the UNTIL NOW portion is required here unlike in standard NRQL. Without the UNTIL NOW added, the system will query a 5 minute slice of data starting 15 minutes ago SINCE 15 minutes AGO UNTIL NOW COMPARE WITH 1 day ago Copy Query: Compare a specific time range to the same range a month ago SINCE ‘2021-03-07 07:00-0500’ UNTIL ‘2021-03-08 07:00-0500’ COMPARE WITH 1 month ago Copy Or: SINCE ‘today at midnight’ UNTIL ‘now’ COMPARE WITH 1 MONTH AGO Copy Example: Unusual increases in error count The default view of New Relic Lookout shows application status across your estate, comparing the last five minutes to the hour before. Under regular operation, most large systems may have a handful of abnormalities, but usually most things will indicate normal behavior. Suddenly, several circles begin to change to red under the Errors section. This indicates that several applications are experiencing unusual increases in error count. It may be that one or two circles for important systems are red, and perhaps much larger than they usually appear. Clicking one of these can provide more information on what is happening. You might see that the error rate is substantially elevated, even thousands of percent higher than normal. To troubleshoot this issue, here's what you might discover in the New Relic Lookout tabs: Performance would show you data about other signals, illuminating the characteristics of the change in system dynamics. Correlations would surface other applications that are affected and how, as well as opportunities to pivot to other applications that may be closer to the underlying causes. Traces, in turn, would show distributed traces, which can provide specific examples of traffic running through those systems. Abnormal history would show other times in the past week with elevated errors, showing whether or not this problem happens regularly, such as every day at the same time or whenever there is a deployment. Profiles might show that all or most of the new errors share common properties, such as all being isolated to just one region/account/user. Combining the information from these sections, not only can you get a sense of what is going on, but also where to focus actions to resolve the problem.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and you want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Assign users access to accounts (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your New Relic APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various agent languages. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your New Relic APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from our monitoring solutions, like APM and browser monitoring. The New Relic add-on supports Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Install the New Relic add-on To set up the New Relic add-on, see Heroku's documentation, including available plan levels and Toolbelt procedures. If you have problems, use the Heroku support channels. Configure the agent After you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, follow the configuration procedures for your New Relic APM agent. Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

Java The minimum agent version for Java is 3.17.1 or higher. To install and configure New Relic's Java agent for your add-on, see our Java agent and Heroku documentation. Node.js To install and configure our Node.js agent for your add-on, see: New Relic's Node.js and Heroku documentation Blog post (2013) with a \"real world\" example of installing our Node.js agent for a Heroku app PHP To install and configure our PHP agent for your add-on, see our PHP agent and Heroku documentation. Python To install and configure our Python agent for your add-on, see our Python agent and Heroku documentation. Ruby To install and configure our Ruby agent for your add-on, see our Ruby agent and Heroku documentation. If you are using our Ruby agent with a non-Rails application, Heroku users need to install the plugin in your repository manually. For example, in a Sinatra app, add the newrelic gem to your Gemfile, and then add the following code to your app: configure :production do require 'newrelic_rpm' end Copy Manage your Heroku add-on accounts Every time you install the New Relic add-on for Heroku, New Relic will automatically create a new account, complete with a unique license key, account URL, and account ID. These three types of information are important for managing each of your Heroku add-on accounts. License key The license key identifies the account where your application reports. To check the license key your app is using: From a command line, run: heroku config | grep -i relic Copy Look for the value of NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY. This license key environment variable will override any other license key that you hard-code into your New Relic config file. Account URL If you install the New Relic add-on multiple times and need to verify the URL your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, look in your agent logs for a line indicating reporting to following by a URL using this format: rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/###/applications/###### Copy Account ID You cannot change your add-on's account ID directly. If you need to change the New Relic account your Heroku app uses for reporting to New Relic, change the current license key environment variable in its config file so that it points to the license key of the New Relic account you want to use: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=changed_account_license_key Copy Log on to New Relic Heroku customers may have two different types of accounts with New Relic: Add-on accounts: New Relic accounts that customers installed on their Heroku application by using Heroku's New Relic add-on \"Regular\" accounts: Other New Relic accounts that customers did not install with Heroku's add-on Regular accounts provide a wider range of features than do add-on accounts, and are installed and managed differently. Different procedures apply, depending on which type of account you want to sign into. In accordance with the terms of New Relic's partnership with Heroku, customers who install New Relic via the Heroku add-on can only access their New Relic add-on accounts by signing in through Heroku. For this reason, if you have both add-on accounts and regular New Relic accounts, you cannot switch directly between them. Sign in to New Relic add-on account through Heroku To sign in to your New Relic add-on accounts: Sign in through Heroku's login page at id.heroku.com/login. Select the application that has the New Relic add-on installed. Select New Relic from your list of add-ons. If you sign in through Heroku, you will not see any of your regular New Relic accounts when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Sign in to regular New Relic accounts To sign into or switch between your regular New Relic accounts: Sign in to New Relic at one.newrelic.com. To switch from one regular New Relic account to another: Go to: **account dropdown and select an account. If you sign in directly through New Relic, you will not see any of your New Relic add-on accounts from Heroku when you select account dropdown > Switch account. Set up deployment notifications The Heroku add-on automatically sends deployment notifications to New Relic for one application per account. If you add multiple applications to your add-on account, you must use the New Relic REST API to manually send deployment notifications for your additional applications. You cannot use a post-deploy hook, because the New Relic REST API call requires a header, and Heroku's post-deploy hook does not allow headers. However, you can write a script that generates this API call whenever you deploy on Heroku. For instructions on recording deployments via the REST API, see Recording deployments. Important When you add a user to the Heroku add-on, this creates a user record for the user at New Relic. However, if you remove the user from the Heroku add-on, the user record is not automatically removed from New Relic. Instead, you must also manually remove the New Relic user record after removing the user from the Heroku add-on. You can do this by going to the User Management page.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see SPA usage. Data generation Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a NrUsage event. Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour. When querying Browser usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. For more information, see the Browser query examples. Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage. On the Browser usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily page views by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Average daily page views The average daily page views for that account or application. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Browser-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards.

Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from.

For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data.

Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage.

Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see SPA usage. Data generation Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a NrUsage event. Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour. When querying Browser usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. For more information, see the Browser query examples. Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage. On the Browser usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily page views by the number of days in the current month.

Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event.

On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see SPA usage. Data generation Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a NrUsage event. Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour. When querying Browser usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. For more information, see the Browser query examples. Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage. On the Browser usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily page views by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Average daily page views The average daily page views for that account or application. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Browser-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account.

When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see SPA usage. Data generation Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a NrUsage event. Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour. When querying Browser usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. For more information, see the Browser query examples. Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage. On the Browser usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily page views by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Average daily page views The average daily page views for that account or application. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Browser-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Browser subscription usage. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. For details about single-page app (SPA) monitoring usage, see SPA usage. Data generation Once per hour, for every monitored application, a New Relic Browser account will generate a NrUsage event. Each event will summarize the usage for the last hour. When querying Browser usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. For more information, see the Browser query examples. Usage calculations Monthly subscription usage equals the total number of page views that month across all end-user browsers. AJAX traffic does not count against your daily usage. If your page views are fairly steady over time, you can estimate usage for the current month. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > View your usage. On the Browser usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily page views by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Account ID New Relic account ID. Average daily page views The average daily page views for that account or application. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not Browser-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Browser attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Browser. To query Browser data, use a productLine attribute value of Browser. Attribute Description browserPageViewCount Number of page views for an application for that 24-hour period. For more on how events are generated, see Data generation.Page views for both Pro and Lite Browser agents are counted. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Browser data, this value is Browser. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Browser, this value is Application. browserAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Browser product. isPrimaryApp Deprecated April 2, 2020. Boolean. true means the application is the primary app. false means the app is one of several apps that an agent reports data for. For more on multiple app names in APM and Browser, see Use multiple app names. The sum of events where this attribute is true will give an accurate total of page views when you are using the multiple app names feature. Counting events where this attribute is false will result in over-counting of usage. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Page views for the last complete month This query shows a count of page views from the last complete month: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Page views for the last week by account This query shows a count of page views from the last week by account: SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 7 days ago FACET consumingAccountName Copy Page views for the past month, by application: This query shows a count of page views from the past month by application SELECT sum(usage) FROM NrUsage WHERE productLine='Browser' SINCE 30 days ago FACET browserAppID Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy SPA usage Page views are used by New Relic Browser to determine customer data usage and product pricing. This document defines a page view in the context of New Relic Browser's SPA monitoring and explains why: SPA monitoring does not affect Browser data usage SPA monitoring will increase Insights data usage In New Relic Browser, a page view is defined as a complete load or reload of a page, signaled by the firing of the window.onload event. New Relic's SPA monitoring tracks traditional page views, but it also tracks changes in the browser that do not require a page load, such as: Route and hash changes Synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript Dynamic server-side updates to a page Route changes are tracked automatically, and by setting up custom instrumentation you can capture almost any type of browser interaction. With New Relic Browser Pro, pricing is based on an account's number of page views per month. If SPA monitoring is enabled, browser interactions that do not require a page load are not counted as page views for billing purposes. With SPA monitoring, you can track an unlimited number of route changes and other custom browser interactions that don't involve page loads. Notes on Insights subscription If you switch from standard Browser monitoring to SPA monitoring, and you also pay for Insights (and don't use only your complementary Insights subscription), your Insights data usage will increase. Because SPA monitoring is a more advanced way to monitor your application, it creates more Insights events than standard monitoring for the following reasons: Page views create not only PageView events, but also BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming events. For the typical SPA-architecture app, there are more route changes than there are standard page loads. If you pay for Insights and your current Insights license is not sufficient for the amount of events generated with SPA monitoring, we will notify you when you have exceeded your data usage plan. To remedy this, the following options are available: Upgrade your Insights plan. Turn off the reporting of some event types. Use the Browser API to manually turn off collection of some events Switch from Browser SPA monitoring back to standard monitoring",

See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection).

For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, see Manage your data. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. If you're on the original product-based pricing plan, you retain your existing subscriptions and data retention values. You manage these existing retention settings from the Data management hub in New Relic One. To manage your retention settings, in New Relic One, click your user name, select Manage your data, and then select Data retention. You'll see your existing retention settings. Adjust retention values by clicking the Edit retention button. New Relic stores different types of data for different periods of time. The retention period for a type of data will vary depending on the product, the subscription level, and the feature. Limits on editing and deleting data Once telemetry data (events, metrics, logs, traces) is reported to New Relic and available for querying, that data cannot be edited or deleted. This is a purposeful design decision that optimizes New Relic's speed and performance. Data will expire after its data retention ends. If you sent unwanted data or sensitive data to New Relic that must be removed, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. Product and API data retention policies Select a New Relic product to see details about its data retention: APM Specific retention policies apply to each New Relic APM subscription level, including Lite, Essentials, Pro, and Enterprise. This includes metric timeslice data, key metrics, trace data, and event data. In addition to retention limits, your data is subject to aggregation (averaging) after certain elapsed time periods. For more information, see the aggregate metric data description. APM data retention policies For accounts on our original product-based pricing, APM data retention policies depend on your APM product subscription level. Component Lite Essentials Pro Metric timeslice data 24 hours 3 days 90 days Key metrics none forever forever Distributed tracing and logs in context none none 8 days Other trace data * 1 day 3 days 7 days Event data * * 1 day 3 days 8 days * If you view a transaction trace in the New Relic UI, New Relic stores that trace data for up to one year. * * Learn about how to extend the retention of event data.

Infrastructure For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Infrastructure data retention policies depend on your Infrastructure subscription level and your New Relic Infrastructure compute units pricing model. Data retention rules apply the same whether that data is displayed in the UI or queried. Tip Infrastructure data retention is not governed by your Insights subscription. Infrastructure downsampling and data retention Types of data are stored depending on your subscription level: Component Essentials Pro Infrastructure data 3 months 13 months Host count Host count will stop reflecting a host whose agent is no longer reporting after three minutes. However, host data will be available, subject to other retention criteria. 3 minutes 3 minutes Inventory attributes removed Inventory attributes for a host are retained for 24 hours after the agent stops reporting. 24 hours 24 hours Integration data Not available with Essentials Limit of 2275 integration events per compute unit per month In addition, Infrastructure downsamples your data on the fly, as it's generated. All Infrastructure metric data types (including On-Host Integrations metrics) will display different granularity depending on the age of the data and the size of the time window. The following table illustrates when different downsampled buckets will be used, both in the Infrastructure UI and for queries: Bucket Size Used For Time Windows Covering... Data Retained For... Raw (5, 10 or 15 second) 0 to 59 minutes 7 days 1 minute 60 minutes to 6 hours 30 days 10 minutes 6 hours to 3 days Full account retention period 1 hour 3 days to 14 days Full account retention period 3 hours 14+ days Full account retention period Integration compute unit event limits The 2275 limit on integration events per compute unit per month is a limit on total Infrastructure integration events. It's not a limit of 2275 for each integration's events. Additional details and clarifications about this limit: This limit applies to all events from all integrations (cloud integrations and on-host integrations). The events are all handled the same. Default data received by the Infrastructure agent does not count against the 2275 event per compute unit limit. If you exceed your limit, we do not enforce this limit. If you exceed your limit, we'll review pricing options with you to ensure you get the most cost-effective pricing for your organization's integrations. Insights For accounts on our original product-based pricing, an Insights subscription extends your event data retention. An Insights Pro subscription allows you to customize the length of your event data retention. Logs For accounts on our original product-based pricing, log data can be retained for up to 30 days by New Relic. Shorter retention periods of 8 or 15 days are also available. Logs in context data retention New Relic Logs logs in context data retention policy is based on your current APM product subscription level. For more information, see APM data retention. Mobile For accounts on our original product-based pricing, Mobile data retention policies depend on your New Relic Mobile product subscription level. This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and event data. For information about your subscription-related data usage, see Mobile subscription usage. Mobile data retention policies Component Lite Enterprise Overview page data 24 hours 90 days Crash data and stack traces 24 hours 90 days HTTP requests (except errors) as metric data Unavailable 90 days HTTP request errors as metric data Unavailable 3 days Interaction traces Unavailable 90 days Custom events * Unavailable 1 day Mobile events * 1 day 8 days MobileBreadcrumb events * Unavailable 3 days MobileCrash events * 1 day 90 days MobileHandledException events * Unavailable 3 days MobileJSError events (React Native beta) * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequest events * Unavailable 3 days MobileRequestError events * Unavailable 3 days MobileSession events * 1 day 90 days * Learn how to extend retention of event data.

This includes data components such as metric data, aggregate metrics, key metrics, trace data, and Insights events. Tip Synthetics events do not count against an Insights Pro subscription. Your current subscription level appears in the right column of the Account summary page: Go to synthetics.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary. Synthetics data retention policies Component Lite Pro Synthetics monitor data 2 weeks 13 months Event data 2 weeks 13 months Also see the data retention details for APIs, including: Metric API All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Trace API See Trace API general requirements and limits. Data components For accounts on our original product-based pricing, the section below provides an explanation of some types of data components governed by the data retention rules of specific products: Event data: reported by most products See Event data retention for information on the event data type. Metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Metric timeslice data is a specific type of data that is used for most metric charts and reports in New Relic APM, Mobile, and Browser. Important Note that metric timeslice data differs from other metric data types. All metric timeslice data is aggregated, but New Relic deals with fresh data and old data in different ways. Fresh data has specific policies applied to the data to keep granular views of performance as aggregate metrics. As data ages and becomes less useful in a granular state, we summarize that data and only keep key metrics. Aggregate metric timeslice data: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile Aggregate metric timeslice data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and response times. In the New Relic UI, you see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. Metric data aggregation depends on your subscription level. Subscription Level Aggregate retention Enterprise Aggregates (averages) to 1-hour periods after 8 days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in 1-hour periods. This means you cannot obtain data granularity of less than 1 hour after 8 days, and only a subset of metrics are available after 90 days. Pro After 8 days Essentials After 3 days. Legacy Small Business, Startup, and Standard After 3 days. Lite After 2 hours. We retain your most recent data in one-minute increments. We also aggregate permanent metric data to day-size increments after 90 days. When looking at older data in small time windows, you may notice that charts show less detail. As data ages, it is aggregated into larger segments. Key metrics: reported by APM, Browser, and Mobile New Relic retains certain \"key\" metric timeslice data aggregations forever for Enterprise and Pro customers, for any number of applications. New Relic aggregates permanent key metric data to hour-size increments after 90 days. Product Key metrics APM Apdex, for app server Throughput and page views Response time, plus breakdown into tiers or categories on your app's main Overview chart Page load time, plus breakdown into segments Error rate CPU usage Memory usage Browser Apdex, for browser Browser page load time Throughput total. After 90 days, there is no breakout by browser type, and only the combined average value is available for the time range requested.

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options.

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Synthetics accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. Once per day, every Synthetics monitor location will generate an NrDailyUsage event for every monitor type. This event will summarize Synthetics usage for that location and monitor type over the last 24 hours. All Synthetics usage events have a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. For more information, see the Synthetics query examples. Usage calculations A New Relic Synthetics subscription level is based on the number of non-ping monitor checks used during a calendar month. If your monitor checks are fairly steady over time, you can estimate the current month's eventual usage. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To view usage information in the UI: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Synthetics usage page, set the time picker to Last 30 days. Multiply the Avg daily paid checks by the number of days in the current month. The Synthetics usage chart displays the daily count of monitor checks. The table value Avg daily paid checks displays the total number of monitor checks for the selected time period, divided by the number of days. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to subscription usage data. General attributes The following are general (not Synthetics-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Synthetics attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Synthetics. To query this data, use a productLine attribute value of Synthetics. Attribute Description productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. Synthetics data will have the value Synthetics. Use this value when querying Synthetics usage data. syntheticsFailedCheckCount Number of failed checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Failed checks count toward subscription usage for Synthetics. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsSuccessCheckCount Number of successful checks that ran on the given day for the given Synthetics monitor and location. Only checks with syntheticsType not equal to SIMPLE count toward billable subscription usage. syntheticsLocation Location the check ran in. syntheticsLocationLabel Human-readable label for the location of the check. syntheticsType The type of Synthetics monitor. Possible values: SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_BROWSER, SCRIPT_API. For more information, see Monitor types. syntheticsTypeLabel Human-readable label for syntheticsType. Possible values: Ping, Simple Browser, Scripted Browser, Scripted API. syntheticsMonitorName Name of the monitor. syntheticsMonitorId Unique ID of the monitor. usageType The type of entity for which this event records usage data. This value is Check for Synthetics. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your Synthetics subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Billable checks for the last month This query produces a chart of the billable monitor checks over the last month. Remember that a syntheticsType of SIMPLE refers to a ping monitor, which doesn't count towards paid usage. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT sum(syntheticsFailedCheckCount) + sum(syntheticsSuccessCheckCount) AS 'Paid checks' where productLine='Synthetics' AND syntheticsType != 'SIMPLE' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Account hierarchy This is a non-product-specific query useful for seeing your account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts).

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, this document explains how we calculate billable usage for Mobile accounts. This document also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, for every monitored application, a New Relic Mobile account will generate an NrDailyUsage event. Each event summarizes the Mobile usage for the current calendar month, up to and including the last 24 hours. To query Mobile usage data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. For more information, see the Mobile query examples. Usage calculations New Relic Mobile subscription usage is based on the concept of monthly active users (MAUs). For a mobile app monitored by New Relic, MAUs will represent a cumulative count of unique users that used that app during a calendar month. Each unique end-user mobile device counts as a \"user\" for the purposes of this metric. For accounts that have multiple apps, total account usage will represent a sum of the MAUs for all the apps under that account. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's billable usage: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the Mobile usage page, set the time picker to Current month. The Mobile usage chart and table display the maximum MAUs that have been reached over a given time period. It will usually ramp up quickly at the beginning of the month, then grow slowly throughout the month. Because it represents the maximum value found so far, it will never go down. This makes Mobile usage different from other New Relic usage measurements, which are based on summing daily usage. For more information about the usage UI, see Introduction to New Relic subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account, or a customer partnership. Application name The name of the mobile application. Application ID New Relic Mobile application ID. Maximum MAUs Maximum monthly active users. For the current calendar month, the highest count of active users that has been reached. This number can be compared to the MAUs included in your New Relic subscription. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage that is attributed to the group (account or application, depending on the Group by selection). General attributes The following are general (not Mobile-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts and child accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account that is either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the sub-account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. Mobile attributes The following are usage-related attributes generated by New Relic Mobile. To query Mobile data, use a productLine attribute value of Mobile. Attribute Description mobileAppId ID uniquely identifying the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the Mobile product. mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth Number of unique users (device IDs) counted during the current calendar month to date for a Mobile app. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. For Mobile data, this value is Mobile. usageType The type of entity this event records values for. For Mobile, this value is Application. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your subscription usage data. You can run NRQL queries, and use the resulting charts in dashboards. Monthly active users (MAUs) for last complete month A chart of monthly active users for the last complete month: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month TIMESERIES 1 day Copy The billable MAU number for the month is the maximum number on this chart. You can also get the billable number for a given month directly with this query, using the last day of the month in the since clause, for example: SELECT sum(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage SINCE '2018-05-31' UNTIL '2018-06-01' Copy Monthly active users (MAUs), by app, for last complete month A count of monthly active users from the last complete month, faceted by application name: SELECT max(mobileUniqueUsersPerMonth) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE last month UNTIL this month FACET mobileAppName Copy The sum of these numbers will be the account's billable MAUs for the last complete month. Unique mobile apps in the last month This query shows a count of unique mobile applications over the past month: SELECT uniqueCount(mobileAppName) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='Mobile' SINCE 1 month ago Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent accounts, child accounts): SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName,masterAccountName,masterAccountId,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId LIMIT 1000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For accounts on our original pricing plan, our usage UI lets you predictably track your data usage, and see how that may affect your pricing. This document explains how New Relic calculates billable usage for APM accounts that have CU-based pricing (not host-based pricing), and also provides available subscription usage attributes and example NRQL queries to use in the New Relic UI or with API calls. Data generation Once per day, an APM account will generate an NrDailyUsage event for: Every application instance created over the last 24 hours Every unique host on which an application instance existed over the last 24 hours These two types of events allow your usage data to be queried and analyzed in many different ways. To query the application events, use a usageType attribute value of Application. To query the host events, use a usageType attribute value of Host. All APM events use a productLine attribute value of APM. For more information, see APM query examples. Usage calculations Monthly billable CUs for a host are calculated by the size of the host running APM (number of CPUs + GBs of RAM) multiplied by the number of hours the host is connected to New Relic during that month. For more on how this is calculated, see CU-based pricing. Tip Only the account Owner and Admins can view the usage UI. However, anyone in your account can query usage data using the NrDailyUsage event. To get an estimate of the current month's eventual billable CUs: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage. On the APM usage page, set the time picker to Current month. Multiply the Avg daily compute units by the number of days in the current month. For more information about the usage UI, see Intro to subscription usage data. Table definitions Here are definitions of the column headers displayed in the UI table and CSV files. The columns visible depend on the Group by option selected at the top of the page. Header Definition Account name The name of the account. This can be a standalone account, a parent account or a customer partnership. Host ID The unique identifier for that host. If the host is in AWS, we use the AWS-provided instance ID. For other hosts, New Relic assigns a host ID. For more about how this value is created, see hostID. Agent hostname The name of the host, as reported by the agent. For more about this value, see agentHostname. Average daily compute units The average daily compute units used. % of total usage The percentage of the total usage used. General attributes The following are general (not APM-specific) account-related attributes. These attributes can help you understand how your accounts are using New Relic products. Attribute Description consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. consumingAccountName Name of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. masterAccountId The ID of the parent account, also known as the master account. This is the account that's either responsible for stored events or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent account is the consuming account, masterAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is present even for accounts that don't have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. masterAccountName Name of the parent account (also known as the master account) that's either responsible for stored events, or that is the parent of the consuming account. When a parent is the consuming account, masterAccountName is the consumingAccountName. This attribute is present even for accounts that do not have a parent account. This is to ensure continued reporting if the account is later made a parent account. partnershipId Partner ID of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a New Relic customer partnership. partnershipName Name of the New Relic customer partnership associated with the account responsible for the stored events. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is associated with a customer partnership. subAccountId ID of the child account that is responsible for the stored event. When this attribute is present, subAccountId is the consumingAccountId. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). subAccountName Name of the child account responsible for stored events. When present, this attribute is the same as the consumingAccountName. This attribute is only present if the consuming account is a child account (not a parent account). timestamp UNIX timestamp (seconds since epoch) of the day and time when event generation was initiated. APM attributes (CU-based) The following are usage-related attributes generated by CU-based APM accounts (not host-based APM). To query APM-specific data, use a productLine attribute value of APM. Attribute Description agentHostname ID reported by the agent to uniquely identify the host for which this usage event is reported. This value can come from several sources in the application’s environment, but commonly is the value returned by the gethostname Linux syscall. In Docker environments, this attribute can take on the value (sometimes truncated) of the Docker container ID. agentHostname is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. apmAgentMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentProcessorCount Number of logical CPU cores available to the host, as detected by the New Relic agent from the host OS. apmAgentVersion Version of the New Relic APM agent running in the application instance reporting this usage. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. To update your agent version, see Update the New Relic agent. apmAppId ID uniquely identifying the application that is reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmAppInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the application instance (the process running the New Relic APM agent). apmAppName Name of the application reporting this usage, as it appears in the APM product. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmBillingInstanceSize Size of the host, for CU-based billing purposes. Calculated as apmProcessorCount plus (apmMemoryBytes/(1024^3)), or the number of processors plus memory (GiB). apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, as defined by the cloud provider for the host’s instance type. apmComputeUnits Number of compute units (CUs) recorded for the given host. CUs are calculated as apmHoursUsed multiplied by apmBillingInstanceSize. For more information, see CU-based pricing. apmComputeUnitRule Describes the algorithm used to calculate the host size for CU usage. Values include: agent_collected_calculated_data: Use the host size data collected by the agent from the OS environment. cloud_provider_data: Use the host size data from the cloud provider. missing_data: Some host size data was missing. This could be due to an older agent that doesn't support reporting CPU and memory sizes, or an agent and OS combination for which CPU and memory sizes are not supported. This will result in the default host size (16) being applied. apmContainerCount The number of unique container IDs associated with this host. Present only for events where usageType equals Host. apmHoursUsed Number of hours for which usage was recorded for the given entity. When an entity is connected to New Relic for any amount of time within a given hour, that hour is counted toward usage. apmLanguage Name of the language that the usage-reporting application is written in, as reported by the New Relic agent. Examples: ruby, java, python. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. apmMemoryBytes Bytes of RAM available to the host. Used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedMemoryBytes, apmAgentMemoryBytes. apmProcessorCount Number of logical processors available to the host, used to calculate apmBillingInstanceSize. The value of one of these attributes will be used: apmCloudDerivedProcessorCount, apmAgentProcessorCount. bootId Linux boot ID of host for which this usage is reported, which is unique for each boot lifetime of each Linux operating system instance. Will only be present when the New Relic agent is one of the following versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher bootId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceId ID uniquely identifying the cloud host instance (example: an AWS EC2 instance) for which this usage is reported. (For example, for an AWS EC2 instance, the value would look like i-1234abcd5678ef900.) This is used to uniquely identify the host if the apmComputeUnitRule is cloud_provider_data. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. Agents with these versions will detect cloud provider data for AWS: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.18.0 or higher .NET: 5.1.72.0 or higher Node.js: 1.21.0 or higher PHP: 5.5.0 or higher Python: 2.54.0.41 or higher Ruby: 3.12.1.298 or higher cloudInstanceId is one of three possible providers for the hostId value. cloudInstanceSize Size of the cloud instance for this host for CU-based APM billing purposes, as calculated according to the formula for apmBillingInstanceSize, using the CPU and memory sizes associated with the instance type defined by the cloud provider. Will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudInstanceType Instance type of the host as defined by the cloud provider and detected by the agent. For example: c4.2xlarge. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudProvider Name of the cloud provider for this host. Example values: aws, azure. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. cloudZone Name of the zone that a cloud provider host is located in. For example: eu-central-1b. This will not be present if no cloud provider was detected by the agent. containerId ID of the Docker or other Linux container in which the application instance is running. This will not be present if a container was not detected by the agent. Present only for events where usageType equals Application. This attribute is not used to uniquely identify hosts for billing purposes. hostId ID used to uniquely identify the host for which this usage is reported. Any given hour of APM usage for this host will be counted only once when calculating apmHoursUsed. There are several possible host identifiers reported by the New Relic agent. The attributes, if present, will be chosen to use in this order of precedence: cloudInstanceId, bootId, agentHostname. instanceSizeCapped This is True if the calculated host size was greater than 16 and therefore capped. missingCpuData This is True if the APM agent reports no CPU count. missingRamData This is True if the APM agent reports no memory count. productLine The New Relic product the usage data is from. APM usage data will have the value APM. Use this value when querying APM usage data. usageType For APM, this value can be either Application or Host, depending on the type of entity this event records usage for (other New Relic products will have different values for usageType). Events with both values are recorded so that usage can be broken down in many ways. For Application: the event represents usage for a single unique application instance for that day. For Host: the event represents usage for a single unique host for that day. Only Host entities are used to calculate billable usage. Application entities are useful for comparing usage between applications, but are not used for billing or contract purposes. Query examples Here are some examples of NRQL queries you can use with your account usage data. Usage for last month SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' SINCE last month UNTIL this month Copy Monthly usage for last year SELECT SUM(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Host' AND productLine='APM' FACET monthOf(timestamp) SINCE 12 month ago limit 13 Copy Instance-CUs per application This query measures the total number of CUs used by all instances (processes) of an application in the last 24 hours. It's useful for determining which applications are responsible for APM usage, but does not return results that match precisely how New Relic prices APM usage. Each application instance is counted separately in this query, even if it runs concurrently with another application instance on the same host, so the number of application instance-hours is likely to be greater than the number of host-hours (the billable quantity). SELECT sum(apmComputeUnits) FROM NrDailyUsage WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' FACET consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId,apmAppName SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy host usage report This query returns data once provided in the \"host usage report\": a listing of applications running on each host. Note that while APM usage is counted on an hour-by-hour basis, per-hour usage data is no longer available via the API or UI. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT min(timestamp) AS 'Earliest reporting day',max(timestamp) AS 'Latest reporting day' FACET apmAppName,hostId,agentHostname,consumingAccountName,consumingAccountId WHERE usageType='Application' AND productLine='APM' SINCE 1 month ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Legacy per-host usage report This query produces a close approximation of the CSV report you would have gotten in the deprecated UI system: FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT consumingAccountId AS 'Account ID', hostId, cloudProvider AS 'Host provider', cloudInstanceType AS 'Instance type', apmBillingInstanceSize AS 'Instance size', apmHoursUsed AS 'Hours used', apmComputeUnits AS 'Usage (CU)', apmMemoryBytes/(1024*1024*1024) AS 'Total RAM', apmProcessorCount AS 'Logical processors', apmContainerCount AS 'Container count', apmComputeUnitRule AS 'Business rule', missingCpuData, missingRamData, instanceSizeCapped, cloudZone, cloudInstanceId WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Host' SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy This NRQL query is different than the legacy usage report: Per-host query Comments Time period This query includes only the last 24 hours of usage. To see the usage aggregated over a longer time period, change the SINCE clause. Results limited to a maximum number of rows NRQL limits the number of rows returned. If you have more hosts than the maximum number of rows returned and want to get the complete set of hosts, you can narrow your query with more WHERE clauses to return subsets of the data (for example, WHERE cloudInstanceId LIKE “%0”) to divide the data into up to 16 groups, modulo the last character in the AWS instance ID. Docker container IDs A single Docker container ID does not appear in this report. A Docker container ID is reported only at the application instance level of granularity (usageType='Application'). For the host (usageType='Host'), a count of unique containers is reported, since there are often very many. While choosing just one container ID to report for a host had been informative, now there is more data reported at the appropriate level of granularity. Business rule Business rule has been replaced with two attributes: apmComputeUnitRule defines how the size of the host was calculated, depending on what data was available from the agent. It no longer describes whether the agent needs to be updated to provide more accurate host naming in a container environment (update_agent_for_container_environment). missingCpuData, missingRamData, and instanceSizeCapped are boolean flags describing what the value missing_data means when it is present in the apmComputeUnitRule attribute. Agent version information Use this query to see which agent versions are running on your applications in the last 24 hours. This information can be useful in determining whether the agent needs to be upgraded to report a more accurate host name in a Docker container environment (either a Linux boot ID or a cloud provider instance ID). FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT count(*) WHERE productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId, consumingAccountName, apmAppName, apmAgentVersion, apmLanguage SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Agents needing updates for container tracking This query helps identify applications where an agent is reporting a hostname that may be the same as a container ID. The result of the query is not a definitive list of such applications, but helps you determine which applications may be affected. Hosts that are inaccurately named after a Docker container will have a hostId value that is the same as the first part of the containerId value. The apmComputeUnitRule != ‘cloud_provider_data’ clause removes from consideration hosts that are named by the cloud provider and thus not named after an ephemeral container. FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT latest(hostId) WHERE containerId is not null AND apmComputeUnitRule != 'cloud_provider_data' AND productLine='APM' AND usageType='Application' FACET consumingAccountId,apmAppName,apmAgentVersion,apmLanguage,containerId SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 2000 Copy Account hierarchy This query is useful for seeing the account hierarchy (partnership, parent, child accounts). SELECT count(*) FROM NrDailyUsage FACET partnershipName, masterAccountName, masterAccountId, consumingAccountName, consumingAccountId LIMIT 2000 SINCE 1 day ago Copy Use of Docker or other containers Some previous New Relic APM agents may miscount containers as hosts, which may lead to over-reporting of compute unit (CU) usage. To fix this calculation for Linux-based containers (including Docker), upgrade your APM agent to these versions: Go: 1.11 or higher Java: 3.42.0 or higher .NET: 6.19.330.0 or higher Node.js: 2.1.0 or higher PHP: 7.5.0.199 or higher Python: 2.90.0.75 or higher Ruby: 4.4.0.336 or higher",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Child accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic. View or change current subscription To view or change your current subscription options: From the account dropdown, select Upgrade subscription/Change subscription. OR From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Subscription.

      "body": "New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements This doc is for users on our original user model. If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "In 2020, New Relic released both a newer pricing plan and a newer account/user model. Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

New Relic One account/user model Important This section is about organizations on the New Relic One account/user model, not the original model. Learn more about the difference. At New Relic, an \"organization\" represents a New Relic customer. The organization contains everything relevant to a New Relic customer: its accounts, its users, and its data. A New Relic \"account\" can be considered a workspace. For example, you might have an account for a specific app, or a set of related hosts and services for a specific initiative or project, or you might have an account for a specific team. Our Standard Full Stack Observability edition allows for a single account per organization. Pro and Enterprise editions allow for multiple accounts per organization. Currently you can't add accounts to your organization on your own. To add accounts, talk to your New Relic account representative. How users access accounts In your organization, your New Relic users are granted access to specific accounts that are relevant to their duties and responsibilities. To manage users’ access to accounts, you create access grants, which assign a group of users to a specific role on a specific account. For example, you may assign some users the ability to manage billing on some accounts, and assign some users as non-admin full users on some accounts, and assign some users as basic users on some accounts. Our user management system allows you to create the user access you need, whether that’s a relatively simple setup with just a few roles across a few accounts, or a complex one with many roles across many accounts. Learn more about user management. Note that some features, like dashboards and workloads, can display data from across different accounts in an organization. This means that if a user isn’t granted access to all relevant accounts, they may experience missing data. To learn more about access issues, see Factors affecting access.

      "body": "New Relic's global data hosting structure consists of two regions: the European Union (EU) region and the United States (US) region. Selecting your preferred region during the account setup process allows you to specify the region where your performance monitoring data will be hosted. You can also create accounts in each region. Requirements Access to the New Relic EU region requires the latest agent version. For new customers: Install the most recent agent version. For existing customers: Update to the most recent agent version. Minimum agent version required: C SDK 1.0.0 or higher Go 2.0.0 or higher Java 4.0.0 or higher .NET 8.0.0 or higher Node.js 3.0.0 or higher PHP 8.0.0.204 or higher Python 3.0.0.89 or higher Ruby 5.0.0.342 or higher Regions and availability Your choice of data center is not limited by your geographic location. You can choose to create an account with data hosted in either the EU or US region, regardless of where you or your systems reside. You can also create accounts in each region. New Relic offers almost all the same active products, features, support offerings, and performance levels in the EU region as what is offered in the US region. Exceptions: The following are not supported with an EU region account: Infinite Tracing is not available. APM's weekly performance reports are not available. The Plugins product is unavailable and is not supported. Errors inbox is not available. Log patterns Deprecated products and features are not available. New Relic's Incident Intelligence service operates solely in the US Whether you store your data in New Relic’s US region data center or New Relic’s EU region data center, by using New Relic Incident Intelligence, you consent that New Relic may move your data to, and process your data in, the US region. Regions and account hierarchy You can create accounts in each region. If your data is currently being hosted in the US region, you must create a new account to store data in the EU region. You cannot view EU data from a US account, or US data from an EU account. The data collected remains separate. The data cannot be aggregated or migrated between accounts. For organizations that have a parent/child account structure, you can only have one parent account. For more, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. For partnership accounts, no changes to the partnership owner account are required. However, data cannot be shared across regions, so a partnership requires a parent account for each region. Hierarchy example for partnership accounts With partnership accounts, a new parent account must be created for any data to be host in the EU region. This hierarchy illustrates how global accounts are structured with partnership owner accounts. Data is not aggregated beyond the parent account. Example hierarchy for partnership organizations. Because data cannot be shared across regions, a partnership will require a parent account for each region. Create an EU region account To create a New Relic account in the EU region: Go to the New Relic signup page. OR If you have a specific offer from a New Relic partner, follow that link directly. Follow the online steps to create your account. From the Select your region dropdown, select European Union. Agree to the Terms of Service. When you receive an email confirmation message, select the link to confirm your account and sign in to New Relic. Then install or update to the most recent agent version. API endpoints for EU region accounts If you have an EU region account, use the appropriate endpoints to access the following New Relic APIs: API EU endpoint Browser source maps API sourcemaps.service. eu .newrelic.com Copy Infrastructure Alert API infra-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Dashboard API rpm. eu .newrelic.com/api/explore/dashboards/list Copy Insert API insights-collector. eu01 .nr-data.net Copy Insights Query API insights-api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Mobile apps rpm. eu .newrelic.com/mobile Copy NerdGraph GraphiQL API api. eu .newrelic.com/graphiql Copy Partner API The partner API is a global API with no regional data differences. Use this endpoint for both EU and US accounts: rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/ Copy REST API api. eu .newrelic.com Copy Synthetics API synthetics. eu .newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Trace API trace-api. eu .newrelic.com/trace/v1 Copy Metric API metric-api. eu .newrelic.com/metric/v1 Copy Log API log-api. eu .newrelic.com/log/v1 Copy Access New Relic One If your accounts report data to the EU data center, use the following link to go to New Relic One: one.eu.newrelic.com. Billing and pricing New Relic's account billing process and pricing options are the same for both the EU and US regions. Operational access and processing Customer Data is hosted in the region selected during account creation. Systems Operations Data is stored in the US region. All other information, including account information (such as license subscription information, billing, and internal monitoring) is hosted in the US region and replicated in the EU region. New Relic may access and process Customer Data in the United States and such other jurisdictions where New Relic has affiliates and subsidiaries, including as may be necessary to maintain, secure, or perform the services, to provide technical support, or as necessary to comply with law or a binding order of a government body. Customer Data from existing New Relic accounts cannot be transferred or shared across regions, and new data generated cannot be shared with existing accounts, even in partnership accounts. Verify your account is based in EU region Use either of these options to verify whether your account data is hosted in the EU region's data center: In APM, mouse over the application name to view the URL. If it begins with rpm.eu.newrelic.com/, it is an EU-based account. Check your New Relic license key. If it begins with EU, it is an EU-based account.",

All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Released in 2014, New Relic Insights was our original way to create custom queries, charts, and dashboards. With New Relic One, we have modernized the experience for you to access, analyze, and visualize your data. New Relic One offers an improved charts and dashboards experience, and it provides a platform where we can more rapidly bring new innovations to you. This transition guide can help you understand: What are some of the new and improved features you get with New Relic One charts, dashboards, and queries Why it's easy to transition to New Relic One What to know and considerations when you make the switch How to get the most out of using New Relic One Features You can scroll down to the transition details, but first here are some features we've added that show how New Relic One dashboards are a clear improvement over Insights dashboards. Improved query abilities With New Relic One, you get: Ability to query many accounts from the same widget: New Relic One lets you query across all your associated accounts in one place. Better querying and charting experiences: Query access is available globally, no matter where you are in New Relic One. This includes a \"basic\" query mode that doesn't require knowledge of NRQL. Improved query experience: You can query both the Metric data type and metric timeslice data. Easy customization: Every visualization now has the query accessible. You can augment any curated chart just by changing the NRQL query. Improved visualizations Not only can you select a wide range of visualization options, you can also add more to your dashboards: Better display options: Make your data easier to understand by using visualizations other than dense, line-heavy charts. New Relic One also offers a better TV mode. Facet linking: You can filter your dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. There's also support for cases. Learn more. More charts or widgets in an area: Insights restricted you to a 3-across limit. Now you can display up to 12 across your dashboard, providing increased data density along with improved tooltips and tracking across charts. Easier creation of multi-page dashboards: Insights referred to these as data apps. Your Insights data apps are preserved as multi-page dashboards in New Relic One. Chart consistency and flexibility: Dashboards include facet color consistency across widgets and faster loading times for more performant dashboards. Also, you can add any chart type to a dashboard in New Relic One! The New Relic Insights UI has served our users well for many years, but it's time to give you an even better experience. Join us and make the switch to New Relic One! Steps for a successful transition The transition to New Relic One has two parts: the UI and mobile app experience (April 12, 2021) and the Dashboard API (July 2021). Insights functionality Transition to New Relic One UI We have already taken care of your transition from Insights to New Relic One for you! As of April 12, 2021, your old Insights URLs redirect automatically to New Relic One. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the new UI features available to you, as described in this transition guide. If you need to view any Insights charts embedded in other websites, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Manage Data. (These older embedded charts will continue to function as expected.) Mobile apps The Insights mobile app is deprecated as of April 11, 2021. Go to the Google Play Store 2 or Apple App store. Delete your old Insights mobile app, and download the New Relic One mobile app. tvOS apps and large displays New Relic's tvOS app is still available. No action is needed by you at this time. Some New Relic customers with the original pricing model may have set up dashboards on wall screens for restricted users with kiosk mode. No action is required for you to continue to view these dashboards. APIs In July of 2021, the Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated and replaced with NerdGraph functionality. For more on this change, and tips on how to migrate, see NerdGraph API for dashboards. Partnership accounts This applies only if your account is one of the few using our partnership account structure to deliver New Relic services to your direct customers. In this situation, the Insights EOL will not affect your customers’ pricing. This is simply an EOL for the UI, not an EOL for the account type. Questions If you have questions about the transition, please comment in our Explorers Hub post. Or, if you work with an account team, they will be happy to help you.",

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "For users on our New Relic One user model, we provide various user management features, including the ability to: Use role based access control (RBAC) to assign default or custom roles to user groups Create custom user groups Grant user groups access to specific roles and accounts Important This doc applies to users on the New Relic One user model. For managing users on our original user model, see Original users. Not sure which user model you're on? See User models. Requirements To see if you can access these user management features, go to the user management UI and see what you have access to. Access requirements: These features allow managing of users on the New Relic One user model. To learn more, see User models. To avoid configuration conflicts, ensure that only one user is managing users at a time. Simultaneous configuration by more than one user may result in errors and unexpected results. Most capabilities require the Authentication domain manager role and some require the Organization manager role. For details, see Standard roles. Pricing edition requirements: To manage user groups, roles, and access grants: Pro or Enterprise edition is required. To import users from an identity provider: Enterprise is required. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. Manage users in the UI For users on the New Relic One user model, to find your user management options: From the account dropdown, select Administration. There are two user management UI pages there: User management: Use this to add users, update user information, and approve upgrade requests. Organization and access: Use this page to create and manage groups, roles, and access grants, and to set up SAML SSO and SCIM provisioning. Important If you can't see these UI pages, it may be because you're on our original user model or because you don't have the required user management role. Overview of user management concepts To optimally use our more advanced user management features, it's important to first understand the concept of the \"access grant.\" An access grant gives a group of users access to a) a role and b) an account. For a New Relic organization that has many accounts, groups typically require more than one access grant because users in a group usually need access to multiple accounts and roles. The diagram below explains the elements that make up an access grant. Note that if your organization is on Standard edition and you want to assign a user to a default group (Admin or User), you don't need to create an access grant: you would simply add a user to that group and you're done. But for Pro and Enterprise edition, if you're trying to grant users access to a custom group, a custom role, or to other accounts, you must create an access grant. A diagram explaining how you can grant user groups access to roles and accounts. Note that this applies to users on our New Relic One user model (and not our original user model). Some tips on setting up access grants: It may help to first plan out how your access grants will be organized. How many accounts will you have? What user groups will get access to which roles and which accounts? Will you use our default groups and roles or create your own custom groups and roles? For smaller, flatter organizations that are okay with full internal transparency, you may only need a couple groups. A common configuration for organizations with many accounts (roughly 20 or more) is setting up groups with the more organization-scoped roles (Organization manager, Authentication domain manager, and Billing user) on the primary account, and then on other accounts, setting up groups with the more product-scoped roles (like All product admin, Standard user, or custom roles). For examples of some common user management tasks, see Example tasks. User management definitions Here are some definitions of our user management terms and how they relate to each other: A New Relic organization is the representation of your organization, containing all your accounts, users, and data. For more information, see Organization and account structure. A capability is an ability to use or edit a specific, granular New Relic feature. Examples of capabilities: The ability to modify APM settings The ability to delete alert conditions A role is a set of capabilities. Our default standard roles have various capability sets, and you can create custom roles that have a custom set of capabilities. See some specific New Relic capabilities. A user group has one or more roles associated with it. You assign your users to a group. We have default user groups (Admin and User), and you can make your own groups. An access grant is what grants a user group access to roles and specific New Relic accounts. An access grant essentially states, \"This group is assigned this role on this New Relic account.\" Adding a user to a group doesn’t do anything unless that group is included in an access grant. An authentication domain contains a set of users who are added to New Relic and who log in to New Relic in the same way. For example, you may have one authentication domain for users who log in via username/password and another authentication domain for users who log in via SAML. If a user is a basic user, this takes precedence over any role-related limitations. For more on this, see Basic user and roles. Example user management tasks In the Organization and access UI, you can create custom groups, roles, and grant access to user groups. Here are some example user management procedures: Add, edit, and delete users To add or edit users, use the User management UI. To add users: If you have multiple authentication domains, choose one from the authentication domain dropdown. Click Add user. Complete the process, including choosing user type and user group. Assign users access to accounts (access grants) See our user management tutorial. Create new custom groups and roles See our user management tutorial. Set up SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning See Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. Grant users ability to manage other users To grant your users the ability to manage other users, you'll need to add users to a group that has the Authentication domain manager role. Important Users cannot have only organization-scoped roles assigned; they must also be in a group that has account-scoped roles (for example, the default Admin group). You have two options: From the User management UI, you can add a user to the default Admin group, which includes both of those roles. OR You can assign those roles to a custom group. From the Organization and access UI: Select Access grants, and choose To this organization. Create an access grant that assigns the Authentication domain manager role to a custom group. From the User management UI, add users to that group. To see a tutorial on creating new groups and roles, see Tutorial. Control how basic users upgrade to full users See the authentication domain settings. Track changes To see an audit log of changes to your account, including user management actions, you can query the NrAuditEvent.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which user model you're on? See Overview of pricing and users. With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Child accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic. View or change current subscription To view or change your current subscription options: From the account dropdown, select Upgrade subscription/Change subscription. OR From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Subscription. Options include: Upgrade or downgrade your pricing and subscription levels Cancel your subscription or delete your account Change your account's tax location for billing purposes If you need more help, contact your New Relic account representative, or contact New Relic's Billing Department. View usage To view your subscription usage information: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Usage. View or update billing information To view or update your New Relic account's billing information: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Billing.

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original Product-based pricing. If you're on the newer pricing plan, see New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription, go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Usage > Event data retention. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to Account Settings > Usage > Data management section. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Tip Want a demo of how the UI works? Check out our videos for UI overview and assigning a role. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Usage > Data management section: You can view your current retention plans, modify them, and perform overrides, all in the UI. Parent and child accounts When it comes to parent and child accounts with flexible retention, be aware of the following: Feature Description Account inheritance Retention set for a parent account is inherited by all child accounts, unless a child account has its own custom retention override. Switch between accounts You can toggle between your parent and child accounts by using the Account switcher in the data retention UI. Moving child accounts If a child account is moved to another parent, it will adopt the retention settings of the new parent account it’s under. However, if the child account has its own custom retention override, it’ll persist and ignore the current retention of its parent account. Copy retention values from one child account to others From within a child account, select Copy retentions and use that child account as a source or template to apply those same namespace retention values to one or more other destination or target child accounts. Note: Source and destination child accounts must all be under the same parent account. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. Manage flexible retention via API You can control data retention with either NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) or in the UI. The following API examples show how to alter data retention via the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. List customizable retention event namespaces To list the customizable retention event names spaces for your account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { customizableRetention { eventNamespaces { namespace } } } } } } Copy List active rules on an account To list active rules on an account, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRules { id deletedAt deletedById createdAt createdById retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Show active rule on an account/namespace pair To show the active rule on a specific account/namespace pair, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { dataManagement { eventRetentionRule(namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } } } } Copy Create a new rule To create a new rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCreateEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\", retentionInDays: 8) { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Delete an existing rule If you delete a rule applied to a child account, that child account will adopt the current retention value of its parent account for the given namespace. If you delete a rule applied to a parent account, the default retention value will re-apply for the given namespace. To delete an existing rule, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementDeleteEventRetentionRule(accountId: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, namespace: \"APM\") { id deletedById deletedAt createdById createdAt retentionInDays namespace } } Copy Copy existing child account rules to others You can specify a child account to be the template or source account, and have other destination child accounts adopt the same namespace retention values of the source child account. Note: all child accounts must be within the same parent account. To copy an existing set of retentions, go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql and run the following: mutation { dataManagementCopyRetentions( sourceAccountId: SOURCE_ACCOUNT_ID, destinationAccountIds: [DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_1, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_2, DESTINATION_ACCOUNT_ID_3]) { success failure } } Copy Success and failure will return lists of destination account ids which were successful (or failed) in copying rules from the source account.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics.

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary.

Keep reading to learn about: How the pricing plan and the user model relate to each other Pricing plans explained Account/user models explained How to switch to the new models Overview of how pricing plan and account/user model relate In 2020, we released both a new, improved pricing plan and a new, improved account/user model. These models represent the future, and eventually all New Relic organizations will be on these models. But currently, our older customers may have one of several combinations of these as they either switch to the new pricing or migrate their users to the new account/user model. This table shows how pricing and user model relate to each other: Pricing plan factors Account/user model factors Original pricing If your organization was created before July 30 2020, you remain on our original pricing plan until you transition to New Relic One pricing. For original pricing accounts, you have users on the original user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Note that if you've added users via automated user management, they're on the new model. This means it's possible to have some users on both models. New Relic One pricing An organization is on the New Relic One pricing plan: If it was created on or after July 30 2020, or If it's an older organization but has switched to New Relic One pricing. If your organization was created on or after July 30 2020, your users are on the New Relic One account/user model. If you have an older organization, you have users on the original account/user model unless you've migrated your users to the new model. Pricing plans explained New Relic organizations are on one of two pricing plans: New Relic One pricing: Our new pricing plan is simpler. It bills on a) which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), b) the GBs of data ingested, and c) how many billable full users you have. All organizations created on or after July 30 2020 are on this pricing plan, as are older organizations that have switched to this pricing. There are two versions of this pricing plan. Our original product-based pricing plan: this is based on subscriptions to specific products (for example, APM, Browser, Mobile, Infrastructure). Some organizations have the option to transition to the newer pricing plan: in that case, their users remain on our original user model. Determine pricing plan To determine which pricing plan you’re on: go to one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown, and select Manage your plan. If you see billing information about data ingested and the number of billable users, you’re on the new pricing plan. If you're on New Relic One pricing, you'll see a billing UI like this. Convert to new pricing Some customers are able to switch to new pricing. Learn more about switching your pricing plan. Account/user models explained In this context, the term \"account/user model\" (or simply \"user model\") refers to the structure of a New Relic user record and how it interacts with the broader New Relic organization that it's in. Our two account/user models are: New Relic One user model: this newer, improved user model has these major differences from the original user model: All your accounts and users are contained under a top-level organization. This gives an organization stronger control over managing users and what they can access. One impact of this is that users who work with multiple New Relic organizations may have an email address associated with multiple logins. Users on this model have a different system for managing permissions and account access. Using access grants, you assign users access to specific roles on specific accounts. Original user model: some aspects of this older model that are different from our newer model: There wasn't as much organization-level control over users. For example, a New Relic user had the ability to access multiple accounts they'd been granted access to using a single login. Users on the original user model have a different user management system. To learn more about benefits of the new model, see our blog post about user model changes and an explanation of the new account structure. For impacts and limitations, see Feature impacts. Requirements for new account/user model Here's a synopsis of the factors governing what organizations use the new model: All New Relic organizations that signed up after July 30 2020 have users on this model, and also have the new pricing plan. Some older New Relic organizations have had their users migrated to the new model by New Relic or by using the user migration procedure. Note that switching to the new pricing plan is independent from migrating users. Partner accounts (resellers, managed service providers), and customers using the partnership account structure, cannot yet migrate their users to the new model. Determine which user model you're on To determine what user model you're on, from the account dropdown select User preferences. If you see the UI below, you're on the New Relic One user model. If you see a different UI with more content displayed, you're on the original user model (see original user docs). To determine if you can manage users on the New Relic One user model, see Manage users. The user model is independent of your pricing plan. For how user model relates to pricing, see the Pricing and user model table. Feature impacts of user model The new user model offers many benefits. Here are some feature impacts of being on the New Relic One user model that may be surprising or unintuitive to our existing customers: More separation of organizations/accounts: If you have an email address associated with multiple New Relic accounts, this may mean you need to log out and log back in. Learn more about account access. Adding accounts: Pro and Enterprise edition can have more than one account in their organization. Currently users in these organizations cannot, on their own, add accounts. They must get help from their New Relic account representative. To learn about adding users to accounts, see Manage users. Alerts-related impacts: Policy actions: For alert policies and conditions, some UI locations display the user that made the last modification. For users on the new model, it will display their user ID and not their user name. For example, a policy might read Last modified Sep 7, '20 4:26 pm by user 1234567 instead of by John Doe. If you have user management permissions, you can determine what user this is by going to the User management UI. Notifications: Users on the new model won’t show up as an option when choosing users to receive alert notifications. The result of this is that these users will not get New Relic mobile app push notifications. As a workaround, you can instead use their email address as the notification channel. Changing account name: These users cannot change the name of their organization after it has been created. Transition to new models Some New Relic customers are able to transition to the new models. To learn more about this, see Transition to new models.",

      "body": "New Relic's session configuration feature allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. Requirements This doc is for users on our original user model. If you're on the New Relic One user model, see Session settings. Overview Session configuration allows you to set limits on idle time before your users' browser sessions automatically expire. A message appears three minutes before the system logs them out. Users then need to sign back in to continue. For accounts configured with SAML Single Sign On (SSO), an additional option is available to set how often the users' browser sessions are re-authenticated. Users and Restricted Users can view the time period for automatic timeout, but they cannot change it. To view the timeout value: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Features Tip Owner or Admins The session configuration options provide an additional level of security to ensure that unattended browsers will automatically time out. Session values are automatically stored in the session cookie. Additional features include: Feature Notes Easy setup Admins use the slide bar in New Relic's user interface to select predefined time periods. Default is two weeks. Separate options available by role Admins can choose for Restricted User sessions to never time out even if they select a session timeout setting. This is useful, for example, when you use a Restricted User login for demos. Automatic inheritance for child accounts By default, child accounts inherit the same session configuration as their parent account. Most restrictive by default If users have multiple accounts, the most restrictive setting applies, regardless of which account the user currently is using. Integration with SAML SSO logout URL If the account's SAML SSO configuration does not include a logout URL, New Relic includes a link from Session configuration for the Owner to set it up. If the Admin is not also the Owner, a message about the SAML SSO logout URL requirement appears. Additional re-authentication setting for SAML SSO In addition to the session timeout option, Admins can select the time (15 minutes to 2 weeks, or never) for how often a SAML-authenticated browser session must be re-authenticated. Select the session timeout value The process to select the session timeout value is the same for both SAML and non-SAML configurations. For additional SAML configuration options, see SAML SSO browser reauthentication. To select a predefined period for session timeouts with SAML SSO accounts, the account Owner must have previously identified the logout URL in the SAML SSO configuration settings. If this has not been set up, the account Admin can view the session timeout slide bar but not change it. If the Admin is also the account Owner, the Session configuration includes a link to go directly to New Relic's SAML SSO Configuration and identify the logout URL. For more information, see Setting up SSO. To select a predefined period for session timeouts: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the slide bar to select a time period for idle sessions to expire and log out automatically. Optional: Select the checkbox option if you do not want restricted users' browser sessions to expire. Select Save my changes. Changes take effect immediately. Select SAML SSO browser re-authentication To select a predefined period for SAML SSO-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Authentication > Session configuration. Use the SAML re-authentication time slide bar to select a time period for New Relic to check the browser session. Select Save my changes. Redirect after SAML timeout If you are logged out due to a session idle timeout on an account configured for SAML, you will be sent to the New Relic login page. Because your account is configured for SAML, you do not have a direct New Relic login. To be redirected to your SAML provider for authentication: Enter your email address in the Email field. Leave the Password field blank. Click the Sign In button. You will then be redirected to your SAML provider. Once reauthorized, you will then be returned to the New Relic website.",

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users who are on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020, you likely have users on our original user model (and not the New Relic One user model). One way to quickly check your users' user model: if you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Want to learn more about user model changes? See Overview of user models. Updates about our new account/user model In July of 2020, we released a new account/user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more and more pre-existing organizations to the new model. Some organizations with users on the original user model are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original user model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this UI: select the account dropdown, select Account settings, and select Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. When basic users attempt to upgrade to full users, an upgrade request is sent to all admins. For more about our user types, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Basic users can request to become full users in the UI. They cannot self-upgrade. Basic users will see prompts when attempting to access unavailable features. Requests to upgrade are sent to all admins on that account. No matter what custom group a basic user is assigned to, they always have the capabilities of a basic user: no more and no less. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user has full user access for all accounts. For how to edit user type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of basic user rights for your New Relic account. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Insights, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads. Link dashboards to workloads and save filters. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute these functions, assign the workloads manager add-on role.",

      "body": "Important These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. After obtaining your SAML identity provider certificate, which should be a PEM encoded x509 certificate, and URL, the account Owner can set up, test, and enable the Single Sign-on (SSO) configuration in New Relic. No other role on the account may edit the SSO configuration on the account. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. If your account is set up under a customer partnership, access to this feature will also depend on the settings for that partnership subscription level. Requirements For requirements, including which New Relic users this feature applies to, see Requirements. Parent and child accounts If your account has child accounts, typically you will set up the SSO configuration on the parent account level only. The child account users will still be able to log in through SSO because they will inherit the parent account's SAML SSO configuration. If you need to configure multiple accounts with separate SAML identities (for example, with partnership accounts), use the custom entity ID feature. Configure SSO To help ensure security and account for network time and clock skews, configure your SAML identity provider's validation responses to the shortest time period that is practical (for example, five minutes). New Relic allows a maximum of thirty minutes. To set up your SSO configuration: Read about an option to have users bypass SAML SSO if they use domains you own. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML service provider details. To upload your SAML identity provider certificate, select Choose file, then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Specify the Remote login URL that your users will use for single sign on. If your organization's SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save your changes. Tip If your organization does not use a specific redirect URL, New Relic provides a logout landing page by default. Test SSO After you correctly configure and save your SSO settings, the Test page automatically appears. After each test, New Relic returns you to the SAML SSO page with diagnostic results. To go back and change your configuration settings, select 1 CONFIGURE. Enable SSO When testing successfully completes, a link appears that you can use on your company's landing page for easy Single Sign On with New Relic. As an additional security measure, users cannot sign in until they complete the email confirmation that New Relic sends automatically. After your users select the link in their confirmation email, they can sign in securely with your organization's assigned user name and password. From there they can select any application they are authorized to use, including New Relic. Caution If you disable SAML SSO, New Relic automatically flags all of your Pending users as Active. If you decide to re-enable SAML SSO later, New Relic automatically flags all users except the Owner as Pending, and they will need to confirm their account access by email. Add a logout URL for session timeouts New Relic's Session configuration feature requires a logout URL for SAML SSO-enabled accounts. If you have already configured, tested, and enabled SAML SSO without a logout URL, New Relic automatically prompts the account Admin to notify the account Owner. In addition, if you are the account Owner, New Relic automatically provides a link from Session configuration to go directly to SAML Single Sign On and add a logout URL. Important The logout URL cannot contain newrelic.com anywhere in the URL. The Session configuration feature also includes the option to select an automatic timeout for SAML-authenticated browser sessions to be re-authenticated.",

      "body": "Overview For an overview of our SAML SSO and SCIM docs, first read Introduction to SAML SSO and SCIM. These docs are for setting up SSO for users on our original user model. Single Sign On (SSO) allows a computer user to log in to multiple systems via a single portal. If you are a New Relic account Owner setting up SSO integration for your organization, you must obtain a SAML certificate that identifies the SSO login URL (and possibly logout URL) for your organization. The other types of information required for SSO integration will vary depending on the SAML service provider being used. Requirements Requirements include: These docs apply for managing users on our original user model. For SSO for users on New Relic One user model, see Authentication domains. Access to this feature requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Owner role required SSO settings UI page To find the New Relic SSO settings page: from the account dropdown, click Account settings, then click Security and authentication, then click Single sign on. If you don't see this UI, review the requirements. Providers supported by New Relic For a list of the SAML service providers that New Relic currently supports for SSO integration: From the New Relic title bar, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Security and authentication > Single sign on. Providers include: Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Auth0 Azure AD (Microsoft Azure Active Directory) Okta OneLogin Ping Identity Salesforce Generic support for SSO systems that use SAML 2.0 SAML information in New Relic account To integrate with an SAML provider, the provider will need information from you about your New Relic account. Most of the information you will need is visible on the New Relic SSO settings UI page: Metadata URL: Contains multiple pieces of information in a single XML message SAML version: 2.0 Assertion consumer URL: The endpoint to New Relic SSO (for example, https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNTID/sso/saml/finalize) Consumer binding: Transmission method is HTTP-POST NameID format: Email address Attributes: None required Entity ID: Account URL (default of rpm.newrelic.com) New Relic SAML requirements For SAML providers and service providers like New Relic to be able to work together, their processes must align in certain ways. Here are some aspects of how New Relic implements SSO integration. This will be useful if you are verifying that a specific SAML provider will be able to work with New Relic or if you are troubleshooting implementation problems. SSO considerations New Relic functions and preferences Scope of user credentials (IdP) Should be all users. Type of connection Must be both IdP initiated and SP initiated. Expected SAML profile New Relic uses a POST binding for SP-initiated requests. Expected NameID value format Must be email address. Sensitive info exchanged in SAML assertion? No, only the email address is sent. Session management and logout Does your organization use a redirect URL for logout? If not, New Relic can provide a logout landing page. Plan for users who no longer need access Typically manual deletion by the account Owner or Administrator. Clock synchronization Ensure the SAML identity provider clocks are maintained by NTP.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Server-side configuration transitions some core settings from your language agent's configuration file to the New Relic collector. Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our SPA-enabled Browser agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend the browser Pro agent. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "New Relic APM agents, browser agents, and mobile agents report a type of metric data called metric timeslice data. These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics. Any custom metric names that do not start with Custom/ are subject to all other grouping rules. They may not be visible when querying, or they may not appear as expected in the UI. A custom metric name consists of the prefix Custom/, the category or class name, and a method or label, each separated with a slash. Implement custom metrics Implementing custom metrics requires API calls. The exact details of the API call vary by agent. Tip If you are testing your custom metric implementation, run the agent for at least 10 minutes to ensure that the API call is reported to New Relic. New Relic agent Implementation APM agents C SDK: newrelic_record_custom_metric() Go: app.RecordCustomMetric Java: recordMetric .NET: RecordMetric Node.js: recordMetric PHP: newrelic_custom_metric Python: record_custom_metric and register_data_source Ruby: record_metric and increment_metric New Relic mobile agents Android: recordMetric iOS: recordMetricWithName (Objective-C) or NewRelic.recordMetricWithName (Swift) New Relic browser agent Browser does not support custom metrics. For options on adding custom data to browser, see browser instrumentation. Avoid grouping issues Collecting too many metric timeslices can impact the performance of both your application and New Relic. For example, if you have thousands of individual users, avoid creating metrics to track the performance of their unique user IDs. This could result in such a large number of metrics that it becomes nearly impossible to navigate or make sense of the data. Instead, use a placeholder, such as an asterisk ( * ), instead of individual user IDs. Important To avoid potential data problems, try to keep the total number of unique metric timeslices introduced by custom metrics under 2000. When the total number of unique metric names exceeds 2000, limits begin to apply automatically that affect how data appears in the user interface, such as in charts and tables. For more information, see Metric grouping issues.",

Install C SDK in container environment Requirements: Meet C SDK requirements C SDK version 1.2 or higher Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon. This only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts. To install C SDK for a container environment, we recommend installing the C SDK daemon on a separate docker container: Install the daemon by cloning the C SDK repository and building the daemon. This is done most effectively via the command make daemon. See the README.md for further details. If you are using Docker, you can use the C SDK daemon image on Dockerhub. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument. The value for this argument must be HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening.",

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors. If you still have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips.",

For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;. Giving your application multiple names allows you to aggregate metrics for multiple agents across an entire app or service; for example: config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy With the application configured, you can create a new application to connect to the daemon. newrelic_app_t* app; /* ... */ if (!newrelic_init(NULL, 0)) { printf(\"Error connecting to daemon.\\n\"); return -1; } /* Wait up to 10 seconds for the SDK to connect to the daemon */ app = newrelic_create_app(config, 10000); newrelic_destroy_app_config(&config); Copy 5. Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic. Explore your app's data in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, check your c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files for errors. If you still have problems, follow the troubleshooting tips.",

Add the C SDK to your code To monitor your application with New Relic's C SDK, instrument the features you want to use: Web transactions, transaction events, non-web transactions Segments (for additional levels of timing details) Attributes Errors Then compile and link your app against the C SDK static library. To install the C SDK into your application's code library, follow this procedure. 1. Verify requirements. Make sure your application meets New Relic's compatibility and requirements for the C SDK. Make sure you have a New Relic license key. 2. Include the provided header file. #include \"libnewrelic.h\" Copy 3. Configure logging. Follow the procedures to configure logging for both the C SDK and the daemon. For example: if (!newrelic_configure_log(\"./c_sdk.log\", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO)) { printf(\"Error configuring logging.\\n\"); return -1; } Copy 4. Be ready to provide a meaningful app name. Be prepared to provide a meaningful app name in your initial application configuration; for example: newrelic_app_config_t* config; /* ... */ config = newrelic_create_app_config(\"Your Application Name\", \"LICENSE_KEY_HERE\"); Copy You may give your application up to three different names, separated by ;.

Finish instrumenting your code. To finish instrumenting your code, refer to the example programs in the C SDK Examples documentation on GitHub. For more information about source code and features, see the C SDK's source documentation for libnewrelic.h on GitHub. 6. Compile and link your app. The C SDK's libnewrelic.a is a static library that is already linked with the libpcre and libpthread libraries. To avoid symbol collisions in this linking step, be sure to link against each of these libraries. In addition, to take full advantage of error traces in APM's Error analytics page, link your application using GNU's -rdynamic linker flag. This will allow more meaningful information to appear in the stack trace for the error recording on a transaction using the C SDK's newrelic_notice_error API call. For example: gcc -o test_app test_app.c -L. -lnewrelic -lpcre -lm -pthread -rdynamic Copy 7. Start the daemon and check logs. Start the C SDK's daemon. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile newrelic-daemon.log -loglevel debug Copy Check the output in the c_sdk.log and newrelic-daemon.log files. The C SDK's architecture requires that the daemon must be invoked first before your instrumented application is invoked. Tip To see all of the available options for the C daemon: At the command line, type: ./newrelic-daemon --help Copy For more information, see the C SDK GUIDE.md. View app performance in New Relic To view your app's performance with APM: Generate some traffic for your app, then wait a few minutes for your app to send data to New Relic.

Install C SDK in container environment Requirements: Meet C SDK requirements C SDK version 1.2 or higher Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon. This only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts. To install C SDK for a container environment, we recommend installing the C SDK daemon on a separate docker container: Install the daemon by cloning the C SDK repository and building the daemon. This is done most effectively via the command make daemon. See the README.md for further details. If you are using Docker, you can use the C SDK daemon image on Dockerhub. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument is used to set a port where the daemon is accepting connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Then, use the C SDK in your containerized application: Follow the steps to add the C SDK to your code. Point the C SDK to the daemon by adding a newrelic_init call and passing a valid address argument. The value for this argument must be HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

These agents allow you to report custom metric timeslice data from your application and see it alongside default New Relic data. Create custom metrics to record arbitrary performance data via an API call, such as: Timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data After reporting this data, you can explore and query it. Name custom metrics Start all custom metric names with Custom/; for example, Custom/MyMetric/My_label. The Custom/ prefix is required for all custom metrics.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file.

To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "In order to monitor any application on Linux using a language that can import C libraries, you must: Create a config using newrelic_new_app_config(), connect to the daemon using newrelic_init(), and connect your application using newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to arbitrary code (custom segments) To monitor calls to arbitrary code, instrument custom segments that are within an instrumented transaction. Custom segments appear in the Breakdown table on the Transactions page. To instrument a custom segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Add newrelic_start_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to datastores To monitor calls to datastores, instrument the datastore segments within an instrumented transaction. Datastore segments appear in the Breakdown table and Databases tab on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also view datastore segments as a databaseDuration attribute of APM Transaction events. To instrument a datastore segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_datastore_segment_params_t that describes the datastore segment. Add newrelic_start_datastore_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Tip To configure how the database name and database instance are reported, use the newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t. Report slow query traces for datastore segments (SQL only) Important You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. To report slow query trace data for datastore segments that take longer than the time you specify, enable these settings in your newrelic_app_config_t: Enable slow query tracing by setting transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.enabled to true. To set the threshold, add a length of time in microseconds to transaction_tracer.datastore_reporting.threshold_us. Then, if a datastore call takes longer than the threshold, the C SDK reports it as a slow query. To view slow query trace details, use the Databases and Slow queries pages in New Relic. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument errors In order to use the C SDK to monitor errors in transactions, you must manually instrument your source code by adding the newrelic_notice_error() function to it. Transaction errors and error traces appear on the Error analytics page in New Relic. The C SDK reports the total number of errors and up to 100 error traces per minute. You can also view, query, and visualize transaction errors as APM TransactionError events. Tip To include function calls in error traces, use GNU's -rdynamic linker flag to link your apps when compiling. The -rdynamic linker flag gives you more meaningful error traces. To instrument errors in transactions: Start a transaction. Record an error with newrelic_notice_error(), supplying the required parameters. End the transaction, supplying the required parameters. For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Avoid metric grouping issues When an account or application sends many individual metrics that could be better managed in groups, New Relic uses the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. If your application sends unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, this reduces the effectiveness of charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. To help prevent this situation, see Metric grouping issues.",

For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures. Manually instrument transactions using the C SDK, as described in this document. New Relic defines a web or non-web transaction as one logical unit of work in a software application. After you manually instrument transactions in your source code by adding New Relic functions, you can view the data on the Transactions page in New Relic. You can also instrument segments of a transaction and errors. Instrument a transaction To instrument a transaction so you can monitor it, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the transaction. The function that you use depends on whether you want to instrument a web or non-web transaction. In the following example, the app is created after a call to newrelic_create_app(). For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Add the following code immediately before the transaction that you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. For web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy For non-web transactions: // Example code: newrelic_txn_t *txn; /* ... */ txn = newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(app, \"NAME_YOUR_TRANSACTION\"); Copy Add newrelic_end_transaction() immediately after the web or non-web transaction that you want to monitor, supplying a pointer the transaction, &txn, as a parameter. Instrument segments Once you instrument a transaction using the C SDK, you can instrument segments in it. By instrumenting segments, you can monitor the individual functions and calls inside a transaction. Segments example You have a transaction associated with a checkout process, which processes both shipping information and credit card information. You can instrument your application to break that transaction up into two segments: one segment for shipping and one segment for payment. You can instrument segments to monitor the following kinds of calls: External services using external segments Custom segments for arbitrary code Datastores using datastore segments Slow query traces (SQL databases only) For more information, see the C SDK installation procedures as well as the C SDK libnewrelic.h documentation on GitHub. Instrument calls to external services To monitor calls to external services, instrument external segments that are within an instrumented transaction. External segments appear in the Transactions page's Breakdown table and the External services page. To instrument an external segment, wrap the New Relic functions that start and stop instrumentation around the function you want to monitor: Instrument a transaction. Create a newrelic_external_segment_params_t that describes the external segment, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_start_external_segment() immediately before the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters. Add newrelic_end_segment() immediately after the function you want to monitor, supplying the required parameters.

      "body": "New Relic's C SDK monitors your applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. C applications run from a compiled, native binary file. In order to monitor transactions, you must manually instrument your code by adding New Relic methods to it. This guide helps you to decide which method to use. The method's code, required parameters, and examples reside in New Relic's C SDK documentation on GitHub. Ensure your customization is thread-safe The C SDK supports instrumentation of multi-threaded applications, but it must be initialized before instrumenting multiple threads. When calling any of the following functions, ensure that they are called on the main thread before any other C SDK functions are called: newrelic_configure_log newrelic_init Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions: Check the C SDK compatibility and requirements for your app. Make sure you are using the latest version of the C SDK library, and update as needed. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a web transaction newrelic_start_web_transaction() Start timing a non-web transaction newrelic_start_non_web_transaction() Stop timing a transaction newrelic_end_transaction() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic newrelic_ignore_transaction() Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can instrument segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for any of the following: External services Functions or other arbitrary blocks of code (using custom segments) Datastores Slow query traces (SQL datastores only) If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a segment newrelic_start_datastore_segment()newrelic_start_external_segment()newrelic_start_segment() Stop timing a segment newrelic_end_segment() Manually parent segments newrelic_set_segment_parent() and newrelic_set_segment_parent_root() This is useful, for example, with an asynchronous process when you want to visualize a segment as a child of the transaction's top-level call. For more information, see the manual segment parenting documentation on GitHub. Segments are recorded on the active transaction. When adding a segment to an active transaction, you need access to the newrelic_txn_t* or transaction pointer, returned by newrelic_start_web_transaction() or newrelic_start_non_web_transaction(). Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. This is useful when you want a different level of detail for your transactions. For example: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, you can change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, you can add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this method... Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transaction Add custom attributes to your transaction based on their type: newrelic_add_attribute_int() newrelic_add_attribute_string() newrelic_add_attribute_long() newrelic_add_attribute_double() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this method... See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system Follow the procedures to enable and instrument distributed tracing. Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) Follow the procedures to Instrument calls to external segments. Collect or log errors The C SDK detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way it reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this method... Set logging levels for your app Use newrelic_configure_log() to configure the C SDK logs and command-line flags to configure the C daemon logs. For more information, see the C SDK logging documentation. Report an error newrelic_notice_error() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the C SDK, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events: At New Relic, event data is a fundamental data type. Event data represents a record of a single event at a particular moment in time. This is useful to view or query specific details. Custom event attributes: To include additional metadata about the event, you can add key/value pairs (custom-attributes) to your custom event. Custom metrics: Metric timeslice data is the statistical measure of data that New Relic aggregates so that you can view it in the UI and chart it. Typically metric data has a longer retention period than event data. Custom events The C SDK provides a custom events API that allows you to send custom events to New Relic. To send an event, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy Be sure to review the custom data requirements and limits for guidance on what values are and are not allowed inside your custom event. For more information, see Custom events in APM. Tip If you created a custom event but need to remove it before the transaction has ended, use newrelic_discard_custom_event(&custom_event);. Custom event attributes You can also add int, long, double, and char* (string) attributes to your custom event by using the newrelic_custom_event_add_* family of functions. For example: // Example custom attributes: newrelic_custom_event_t* custom_event=0; custom_event = newrelic_create_custom_event(\"aTypeForYourEvent\"); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int(custom_event, \"keya\", 42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long(custom_event, \"keyb\", 84); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double(custom_event, \"keyc\", 42.42); newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string(custom_event, \"keyd\", \"A string\"); newrelic_record_custom_event(txn, &custom_event); Copy For more information, see the documentation about custom attributes. Custom metrics The C SDK provides the newrelic_record_custom_metric() function. This allows you to record time-based performance data using an API call, such as: Transaction timing data Computer resource data Subscription or purchasing data To create a custom metric, provide a name or other identifier and an amount of time in milliseconds to the function, along with the active transaction. Important Always prefix custom metric names with Custom/. For example: // txn is a newrelic_txn_t*, created via newrelic_start_web_transaction // Record a metric value of 100ms in the transaction txn newrelic_record_custom_metric(txn, \"Custom/MyMetric/My_label\", 100); Copy For more information, see Collect custom metrics. Here are some ways to use your custom data. For code details and examples for these options, see the New Relic globals documentation on GitHub. If you want to... Use this method... Create a custom event to populate with a timestamp and attributes. newrelic_create_custom_event() Timestamp and add the custom event to the current transaction so you can query or visualize it. newrelic_record_custom_event() Enhance your custom event with additional metadata. Add custom event attributes to your custom event based on type: newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_double() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_int() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_long() newrelic_custom_event_add_attribute_string() Discard a custom event after it was created, but before its transaction has ended, to avoid reporting it to New Relic. newrelic_discard_custom_event This is necessary to free the allocated memory for your unwanted custom event in order to avoid leaks in your program.

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Server-side configuration transitions some core settings from your language agent's configuration file to the New Relic collector. Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Server-side configuration transitions some core settings from your language agent's configuration file to the New Relic collector. Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "The New Relic Ruby agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your Ruby app and collect more in-depth data: Overview Public API methods The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation. Important When using the Ruby agent API, ensure that you have the latest Ruby agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent version 4.6.0 or higher. Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Create a new transaction. See Tracing transaction entry points. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See Method tracers. Time something other than a single method call Use the Tracer API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions so you can filter them in the query builder. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that is already visible in the New Relic UI: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See Naming transactions. Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions Use custom attributes. See Adding custom attributes. Mark a transaction as a background job See Monitor custom background jobs. Mark a transaction as a web transaction Pass a :category => :controller option to set_transaction_name(). For more information, see Naming transactions. Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See Ignoring Apdex contributions. Collect or ignore errors Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as ignored or expected. If you want to... Do this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically See Sending New Relic handled errors. Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all Mark the error as ignored. See Error Collector to use the error_collector.ignore_errors config option. Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic Mark the error as expected. See Sending New Relic handled errors, and set :expected to true. Send custom event and metric data from your app APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards Create a custom event. See record_custom_event(). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics Add custom attributes. Pass a hash of attributes to record_custom_event(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See record_metric(). Control the browser agent Usually the browser agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see Add apps to browser monitoring. However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see browser_timing_header(). Instrument calls to datastores Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic See wrap(). Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block See Tracer.start_datastore_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Capture SQL queries along with timing See notice_sql(). Capture non-SQL queries along with timing See notice_statement(). Instrument calls to externals Use these methods to collect data for external requests: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic Use Tracer.start_external_segment(). You must call finish on the object returned by this method. Add cross-account tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request Use add_request_headers(). Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request Use read_response_headers(). Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request Use get_request_metadata(). Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request Use process_response_metadata(). Instrument calls for distributed tracing Important The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher. These APIs require distributed tracing to be enabled. Distributed tracing lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system. For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see Use distributed tracing APIs. If you want to... Do this... Send a payload/header to the called service. See insert_distributed_trace_headers(). Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace See accept_distributed_trace_headers().",

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically NoticeError() Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events Custom attributes Custom metrics If you want to... Use this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic RecordCustomEvent() Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them AddAttribute() Report custom performance data for a specified period of time RecordCustomMetric() Monitor browser performance with browser monitoring To monitor browser performance for your app using browser monitoring and the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: If you want to... Use this... Install the browser agent Use the browser copy/paste method Add the browser monitoring JavaScript code directly to HTML pages BrowserTimingHeader() Change the configuration settings for the Go agent To manage some aspects of New Relic monitoring, you can change your Go agent configuration settings; for example: Turning on high security mode Adding custom labels for filtering and sorting Managing what information is reported",

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this...

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this...

      "body": "The Go agent supports cross application tracing (CAT). Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture. Important Distributed tracing is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Enable cross application tracing with Go You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled configuration flag. Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or creating its own transactions. Creating transactions via http.ServeMux If you're using Go's http.ServeMux and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct CAT headers. Your code should look similar to the following: http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", usersHandler) http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy You can read more about these wrappers in Instrument Go transactions. Creating web transactions manually When creating your own transactions with app.StartTransaction, ensure that you also call Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled: txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req) // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(500) defer txn.End() Copy However, a transaction started without the calls to Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse will not have CAT enabled: // Cross application tracing not enabled txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") defer txn.End() Copy Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's txn.WriteHeader method rather than the standard library's http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader method. // old code // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) // replace with this txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") txn.SetWebRequest(req) writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) Copy Making HTTP requests In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to create an external segment. The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the newrelic.NewRoundTripper method. For example, this code will make a request to http://api.example.com/ that includes the outgoing CAT headers. func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) { client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://api.example.com/\", nil) req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn) return client.Do(req) } Copy If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's http.Request, you'll need to use the newrelic.StartExternalSegment method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy While it's also possible to create an ExternalSegment via a struct literal, this segment will not be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelic.ExternalSegment. func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) { // CAT headers not inserted defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), URL: url, }.End() return http.Get(url) } Copy Get distributed tracing New Relic also offers distributed tracing.

      "body": "The Go agent supports cross application tracing (CAT). Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture. Important Distributed tracing is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Enable cross application tracing with Go You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled configuration flag. Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or creating its own transactions. Creating transactions via http.ServeMux If you're using Go's http.ServeMux and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct CAT headers. Your code should look similar to the following: http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", usersHandler) http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy You can read more about these wrappers in Instrument Go transactions. Creating web transactions manually When creating your own transactions with app.StartTransaction, ensure that you also call Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled: txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req) // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(500) defer txn.End() Copy However, a transaction started without the calls to Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse will not have CAT enabled: // Cross application tracing not enabled txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") defer txn.End() Copy Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's txn.WriteHeader method rather than the standard library's http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader method. // old code // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) // replace with this txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") txn.SetWebRequest(req) writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) Copy Making HTTP requests In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to create an external segment. The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the newrelic.NewRoundTripper method. For example, this code will make a request to http://api.example.com/ that includes the outgoing CAT headers. func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) { client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://api.example.com/\", nil) req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn) return client.Do(req) } Copy If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's http.Request, you'll need to use the newrelic.StartExternalSegment method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy While it's also possible to create an ExternalSegment via a struct literal, this segment will not be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelic.ExternalSegment. func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) { // CAT headers not inserted defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), URL: url, }.End() return http.Get(url) } Copy Get distributed tracing New Relic also offers distributed tracing.

Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture. Important Distributed tracing is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems. Enable cross application tracing with Go You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled configuration flag. Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or creating its own transactions. Creating transactions via http.ServeMux If you're using Go's http.ServeMux and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's WrapHandle and WrapHandleFunc wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct CAT headers. Your code should look similar to the following: http.HandleFunc(\"/users\", usersHandler) http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy You can read more about these wrappers in Instrument Go transactions. Creating web transactions manually When creating your own transactions with app.StartTransaction, ensure that you also call Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled: txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req) // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(500) defer txn.End() Copy However, a transaction started without the calls to Transaction.SetWebRequest and Transaction.SetWebResponse will not have CAT enabled: // Cross application tracing not enabled txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") defer txn.End() Copy Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's txn.WriteHeader method rather than the standard library's http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader method. // old code // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) // replace with this txn := app.StartTransaction(\"transactionName\") txn.SetWebRequest(req) writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer) writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError) Copy Making HTTP requests In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to create an external segment. The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the newrelic.NewRoundTripper method. For example, this code will make a request to http://api.example.com/ that includes the outgoing CAT headers. func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) { client := &http.Client{} client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport) req, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://api.example.com/\", nil) req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn) return client.Do(req) } Copy If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's http.Request, you'll need to use the newrelic.StartExternalSegment method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT. func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) s.Response = response s.End() return response, err } Copy While it's also possible to create an ExternalSegment via a struct literal, this segment will not be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelic.ExternalSegment. func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) { // CAT headers not inserted defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{ StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(), URL: url, }.End() return http.Get(url) } Copy Get distributed tracing New Relic also offers distributed tracing.

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically NoticeError() Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events Custom attributes Custom metrics If you want to... Use this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic RecordCustomEvent() Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them AddAttribute() Report custom performance data for a specified period of time RecordCustomMetric() Monitor browser performance with browser monitoring To monitor browser performance for your app using browser monitoring and the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: If you want to...

You can also extend the agent's performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. Tip To use Ruby or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Compatibility and requirements The Ruby agent supports many of the most common Ruby frameworks and platforms. You can also use the Ruby agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Before you install the Ruby agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. Monitor app performance View the big picture of your app Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app. Create architectural maps of your app. Enable distributed tracing to understand activity in an environment that relies on many services. Install New Relic Infrastructure and view detailed host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly Track key transactions. Create customized dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when errors or problems occur before they affect your users. Track performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details Examine code-level transaction traces and cross application traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Monitor Ruby background processes and daemons. Analyze business data Use the Ruby agent to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes or add your own. Query your data using NRQL. Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the agent After creating a New Relic account, use our launcher or see the installation instructions. Install docs for gem (recommended) Install docs for rails plugin Add Ruby data Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Automatically inject the browser monitoring agent to get visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to fully customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom metrics: Record additional metrics as part of a transaction to gain more insights into your app's performance and business data. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshooting If you encounter issues with the Ruby agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software.

The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this...

Common issues include: No data appears (Ruby) Gems incompatible with the Ruby agent Sending handled errors to New Relic Controlling when the Ruby agent starts Check the source code The Ruby agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs.

      "body": "You can edit configuration settings for the Go agent to control some aspects of how New Relic monitors your app; for example: Turn high-security mode on. Add custom tags for filtering and sorting in the UI. Turn off the collection of errors, transaction events, transaction traces, and custom events. Configuration methods and precedence The primary way to configure the Go agent is by modifying the newrelic.Config struct as part of calling newrelic.NewApplication(), which is part of the standard installation process. With Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher, you can also set a limited number of configuration options using server-side configuration in the UI. The Go agent follows this order of precedence for configuration. If enabled, server-side configuration overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. If server-side configuration is enabled with the Go agent, it overrides all corresponding values in the newrelic.Config struct, even if the server-side values are left blank. Here are detailed descriptions of each configuration method: Server-side configuration (2.7.0 or higher) Server-side configuration is available with Go agent versions 2.7.0 or higher. This allows you to configure certain settings in the UI. This applies your changes automatically to all agents even if they run across multiple hosts. Where available, this document includes the UI labels for server-side config under individual config options as the Server-side label. You must still call newrelic.NewApplication() in your application process following the steps described in the in-process configuration. Configuration options set server-side will overwrite those set locally. Since not all configuration options are available server side, you may want to still update your newrelic.Config struct. Caution If server-side config is enabled, the agent ignores any value in the newrelic.Config struct that could be set in the UI. Even if the UI value is empty, the agent treats this as an empty value and does not use the newrelic.Config value. In process newrelic.Config struct You configure your Go agent from the local in process newrelic.Config struct. This struct can be accessed when calling newrelic.NewApplication(). Add the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Update values on the newrelic.Config struct to configure your application using newrelic.ConfigOptions. These are functions that accept a pointer to the newrelic.Config struct. Add additional newrelic.ConfigOptions to further configure your application. For example, you can use one of the predefined options to do common configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), // add debug level logging to stdout newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), ) Copy Or, you can create your own newrelic.ConfigOption to do more complex configurations: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), newrelic.ConfigDebugLogger(os.Stdout), func(config *newrelic.Config) { // add more specific configuration of the agent within a custom ConfigOption config.HighSecurity = true config.CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Change configuration settings To make Go agent configuration changes, set the values in the newrelic.Config struct from within a custom newrelic.ConfigOption. For example, to turn New Relic monitoring off temporarily for testing purposes, change the Enabled value to false: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy In this and the following examples, config represents your New Relic config struct, although you may have given it a different variable name when you installed the Go agent and initiated the configuration in your app. General configuration settings License (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Specifies your New Relic license key, used to associate your app's metrics with your New Relic account. The license and the app name are both set as part of the New Relic installation process. AppName (REQUIRED) Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the application name used to aggregate data in the New Relic UI. You set both the license and the app name as part of the New Relic installation process. To report data to multiple apps at the same time, specify a list of names separated with a semicolon. Do not put a space before the semicolon itself. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"YOUR_APP_NAME;APP_GROUP_1;ALL_APPS\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends data from your app to the New Relic collector. To turn off New Relic monitoring, set this to false. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Enabled = false }, ) Copy This can be useful for installing New Relic in a development environment or for troubleshooting purposes. When Enabled is set to false: The New Relic Go agent will not communicate with the New Relic collector. The agent will not spawn goroutines. The license key is not required during installation. Labels Type map [ string]string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct Add tags. Creating four tag pairs Here's an example of setting four tags: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.Labels := map[string]string{ \"Env\": \"Dev\", \"Label2\": \"label2\", \"Label3\": \"label3\", \"Label4\": \"label4\", } }, ) Copy Logger Type Interface Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct You can use the Logger interface to write Go log files to a specific location or logging system. HighSecurity Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This feature requires Enterprise tier. High security mode enforces certain security settings and prevents them from being overridden, so that the agent sends no sensitive data. High security mode does the following: Turns SSL on Turns off reporting of error message strings Turns off reporting of custom events This setting must match the corresponding account setting in the UI. For example: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.HighSecurity = true }, ) Copy The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and our REST API. UseTLS (DEPRECATED) Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Important This option was removed in agent version 2.0. Controls whether HTTPS or HTTP is used to send data to New Relic. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default (which uses TLS protocol), and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. HostDisplayName Type String Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This sets the hostname displayed in the APM UI. This is an optional configuration. Transport Type http.RoundTripper Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct This customizes http.Client communication with New Relic collectors. This can be used to configure a proxy. RuntimeSampler.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent captures runtime statistics. Custom events configuration You can create custom events and make them available for querying and analysis. CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent sends custom events to New Relic. This setting is overridden by HighSecurity, which disables custom events. To disable custom events, place the following in your Go app after the New Relic config is initiated: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.CustomInsightsEvents.Enabled = false }, ) Copy Transaction events configuration Transaction events are used in collecting events corresponding to web requests and background tasks. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. TransactionEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects transaction events. TransactionEvents.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionEvents.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from transaction events: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionEvents.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionEvents.MaxSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 Set in newrelic.Config struct Defines the maximum number of transaction events per minute to be sent to New Relic, up to the default maximum of 10,000 transaction events. Error collector configuration The following settings are used to configure the error collector: Tip For an overview of error configuration in New Relic, see Manage errors in APM. ErrorCollector.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection on/off When false, the agent collects no errors or error traces. ErrorCollector.CaptureEvents Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects error analytic events. ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes Type Integer Default Error codes 399 and below, and 404, are ignored. Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Error Collection: Ignore from error collection This controls which HTTP response codes are ignored as errors. Response codes that are greater than or equal to 100 and strictly less than 400 are ignored by default and never have to be specified when calling this function. Response codes 0, 5, and 404 are included on the list by default, but must be specified when adding to the ignore list. This function's default form is: config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{ 0, // gRPC OK 5, // gRPC NOT_FOUND http.StatusNotFound, // 404 } Copy You can also add response codes as HTTPs, as http.StatusNotFound above. Important If used, server-side configuration will override any values set on the newrelic.Config struct. Therefore to ignore 404 when server-side configuration is enabled, you must include 404 in the configuration set in the UI. Example of ignoring error code To add HTTP response code 418 to the default ignore list, which includes 0, 5, and 404: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes = []int{0, 5, 404, 418} }, ) Copy ErrorCollector.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct ErrorCollector.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use ErrorCollector.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for errors. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from errors: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.ErrorCollector.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Transaction tracer configuration Here are settings for changing transaction tracer configuration. For more information about transaction traces, see Transaction traces. TransactionTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing on/off When true, the agent collects transaction traces (detailed information about slow transactions). TransactionTracer.Threshold.IsApdexFailing Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold Controls whether the transaction trace threshold is based on Apdex. If true, then the trace threshold is four times the Apdex threshold. If false, the agent uses Threshold.Duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Threshold.Duration Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Threshold If Threshold.IsApdexFailing is set to false, the agent uses this duration as the transaction trace threshold. TransactionTracer.Segments.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 2 Set in newrelic.Config struct This is the threshold at which segments will be added to the trace. TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction trace segments. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSegmentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSegmentAttributeNames }, ) Copy TransactionTracer.Segments.StackTraceThreshold Type time.Millisecond Default 500 Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Transaction Tracing: Stack trace threshold This is the threshold at which segments will be given a stack trace in the transaction trace. Caution Lowering this setting may drastically increase agent overhead. TransactionTracer.Attributes Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct TransactionTracer.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use TransactionTracer.Attributes.Enabled to turn attribute collection on or off for transaction traces. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allAgentAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Attributes.Exclude = allAgentAttributeNames }, ) Copy Datastore tracer configuration Here are datastore settings, including slow query enabling and settings. DatastoreTracer.InstanceReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct This enables collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on transaction traces and as part of slow query data. DatastoreTracer.NameReporting.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Use this to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. DatastoreTracer.QueryParameters.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent collects datastore call query parameters. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct Controls whether slow queries are captured. DatastoreTracer.SlowQuery.Threshold Type time.Millisecond Default 10 Set in newrelic.Config struct The agent captures slow query data for queries slower than this. Cross application tracing configuration Here are settings for changing the cross application tracing feature. CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct, Server-side config Server-side label Cross-application tracing on/off When true, the agent will add cross application tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for cross application tracing headers. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the Go agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. Distributed tracing configuration Important Enabling distributed tracing requires Go agent version 2.1.0 or higher, and it disables cross application tracing. It also has effects on other features. Before enabling, read the transition guide. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. When distributed tracing is enabled, you can collect span events. DistributedTracer.Enabled Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will add distributed tracing headers in outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing. DistributedTracer.ExcludeNewRelicHeader Type Boolean Default false Set in newrelic.Config struct Set this to true to exclude the New Relic header that is attached to outbound requests, and instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are used. Span events configuration Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing must be enabled to report span events. These settings control the collection of span events: SpanEvents.Enabled Type Boolean Default true Set in newrelic.Config struct When true, the agent will collect span events. SpanEvents.Attributes Important Available for Go agent version 2.6.0 or higher. Type Struct Default Enabled, no exclusions Set in newrelic.Config struct SpanEvents.Attributes is a struct with three fields: Enabled bool Include []string Exclude []string Copy Use SpanEvents.Attributes.Enabled to enable or disable attribute collection for span events. Use Include and Exclude to include or exclude specific attributes. An example of excluding an attribute slice named allSpanAttributeNames from traces: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), func(config *newrelic.Config) { config.TransactionTracer.Segments.Attributes.Exclude = allSpanAttributeNames }, ) Copy Infinite Tracing configuration To enable Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing (set config.DistributedTracer.Enabled = true on the newrelic.Config struct) and add the additional settings below. For an example, see Language agents: Configure distributed tracing. InfiniteTracing.TraceObserver.Host Type string Default (none) Set in newrelic.Config struct For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint.",

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration. If you want to... Use this... Report an error the agent does not report automatically NoticeError() Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all ErrorCollector.IgnoreStatusCodes() Send custom data from your app To record custom data with the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: Custom events Custom attributes Custom metrics If you want to... Use this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic RecordCustomEvent() Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them AddAttribute() Report custom performance data for a specified period of time RecordCustomMetric() Monitor browser performance with browser monitoring To monitor browser performance for your app using browser monitoring and the Go agent, you can use any of the following methods: If you want to... Use this... Install the browser agent Use the browser copy/paste method Add the browser monitoring JavaScript code directly to HTML pages BrowserTimingHeader() Change the configuration settings for the Go agent To manage some aspects of New Relic monitoring, you can change your Go agent configuration settings; for example: Turning on high security mode Adding custom labels for filtering and sorting Managing what information is reported",

The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this...

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add Go data Compatibility and requirements The Go agent requires Golang 1.7 or higher on Linux, macOS, or Windows. For more information, see Go agent compatibility and requirements. Install the Go agent In order to install the Go agent, you need a New Relic license key. Then, to install the agent: From github.com/newrelic/go-agent, use your preferred process; for example: go get github.com/newrelic/go-agent Copy Import the github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic package in your application. Initialize the Go agent by adding the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Instrument web transactions by wrapping standard HTTP requests in your app code. For example: http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy Instrument other transactions you want to monitor. Optional: Instrument segments for an extra level of timing detail. Compile and deploy your application. View your app's data in New Relic Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add Go data Compatibility and requirements The Go agent requires Golang 1.7 or higher on Linux, macOS, or Windows. For more information, see Go agent compatibility and requirements. Install the Go agent In order to install the Go agent, you need a New Relic license key. Then, to install the agent: From github.com/newrelic/go-agent, use your preferred process; for example: go get github.com/newrelic/go-agent Copy Import the github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic package in your application. Initialize the Go agent by adding the following in the main function or in an init block: app, err := newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"Your Application Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(\"__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__\"), ) Copy Instrument web transactions by wrapping standard HTTP requests in your app code. For example: http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, \"/users\", usersHandler)) Copy Instrument other transactions you want to monitor. Optional: Instrument segments for an extra level of timing detail. Compile and deploy your application. View your app's data in New Relic Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the APM UI. If no data appears within a few minutes, follow the troubleshooting tips.

The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to...

The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this...

      "body": "The New Relic Go agent monitors your Go language applications and microservices to help you identify and solve performance issues. The Go agent API is one of several available New Relic APIs. Important Because Go applications run from a compiled, native binary file, you need to manually instrument your code to monitor transactions for your Go applications by adding New Relic methods to it. Monitor transactions Before you manually instrument your code to monitor transactions, make sure that you meet the compatibility and requirements and that you are using the latest version of the Go agent. If you want to... Use this method... Start timing a transaction StartTransaction() Stop timing a transaction txn.End() Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore() Use the standard HTTP library package to monitor transactions HTTP request wrapping Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in New Relic, but you do not have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments. For example, if you want to time a method that has complex logic, you can create a segment for each of the methods in the transaction. To instrument a method within an existing transaction, create segments for the following: Blocks of code Functions Datastores External services If the work is happening in a different goroutine from where the transaction started, you must use the NewGoroutine() API. Enhance the metadata of a transaction You can manage the metadata that New Relic reports for transactions. Here are some examples of when you might want a different level of detail for your transactions: If you are experiencing a metric grouping issue, change the default names for your transactions to make them more identifiable. If you want to create dashboards for your transactions, add custom attributes. If you want to... Use this... Change the name of a transaction SetName() Add metadata (such as your customer’s account name or subscription level) to your transactions AddAttribute() Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app’s connections to other apps or databases: If you want to... Use this... Time a call to an external resource (such as an external service, database server, or message queue) StartExternalSegment() Connect activity to another app instrumented by a New Relic agent Cross application tracing See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Distributed tracing Collect or ignore errors The agent detects errors automatically. If you want to change the way the Go agent reports errors to New Relic, change the error collector configuration.
