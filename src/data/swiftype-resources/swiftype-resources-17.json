      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software.

The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent.

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "Versions affected: All agent versions between (a) 4.12.0 and 6.5.1; and (b) 7.0.0 and 7.4.1 Fix versions: 6.5.2, 6.5.3, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3 Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 We have determined that the new vulnerability identified (CVE-2021-44832) does NOT affect New Relic's Java Agent, unless an additional attack vector would allow write permissions to the host system. In light of this finding, we have determined that no new Agent releases are needed to specifically mitigate this issue. Nonetheless, as part of its next planned release in January, the New Relic Java Agent will use the latest Apache version of log4j (currently version 2.17.1, which patches CVE-2021-44832). We have also determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT vulnerable to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105. This is because the agent's use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. However, we recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. As new versions of log4j become available, we will continue to release new versions of the agent. New Relic Java agent version Apache log4j version 6.5.1 2.15.0 6.5.2 2.12.2 6.5.3 2.12.3 7.4.1 2.15.0 7.4.2 2.16.0 7.4.3 2.17.0 Summary New Relic has released new versions of the Java agent to address critical vulnerabilities in the open source log4j framework that could allow a malicious actor to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java Agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 or higher (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 or higher (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible. If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, you are protected against CVE 2021-44228 and do not have to upgrade again at this time. We have determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105, as the agents use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. We recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. Important If you are on a version of the agent earlier than 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable agent logging. How to disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter) (no restart is required) Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property (restart required) Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable (restart required) You can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Disabling the Java agent logging does not affect the functionality of the agent, and there will be no degradation in observability. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion.

Technical vulnerability information CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 CVE-2021-45105 CVSS 7.5 CVE-2021-44832 CVSS 6.6 Security guidance for New Relic customers related to Apache Log4j vulnerabilities How to help identify systems with vulnerable log4j versions using New Relic Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement the recommended workaround in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? Agent version information is displayed within the Environment page within your New Relic One dashboard. See our docs page for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the workaround outlined above. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already, do I need to update again? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, we recommend also disabling agent logging, as the fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in log4j v2.15.0. We recommend updating to at least the Java Agent 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against this critical vulnerability. While we have released newer Java Agents with log4j 2.17.0, we have determined that updating to 6.5.3 or 7.4.3 is not critical as New Relic's Java Agent is not susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "Versions affected: All agent versions between (a) 4.12.0 and 6.5.1; and (b) 7.0.0 and 7.4.1 Fix versions: 6.5.2, 6.5.3, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3 Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 We have determined that the new vulnerability identified (CVE-2021-44832) does NOT affect New Relic's Java Agent, unless an additional attack vector would allow write permissions to the host system. In light of this finding, we have determined that no new Agent releases are needed to specifically mitigate this issue. Nonetheless, as part of its next planned release in January, the New Relic Java Agent will use the latest Apache version of log4j (currently version 2.17.1, which patches CVE-2021-44832). We have also determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT vulnerable to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105. This is because the agent's use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. However, we recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. As new versions of log4j become available, we will continue to release new versions of the agent. New Relic Java agent version Apache log4j version 6.5.1 2.15.0 6.5.2 2.12.2 6.5.3 2.12.3 7.4.1 2.15.0 7.4.2 2.16.0 7.4.3 2.17.0 Summary New Relic has released new versions of the Java agent to address critical vulnerabilities in the open source log4j framework that could allow a malicious actor to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java Agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 or higher (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 or higher (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible. If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, you are protected against CVE 2021-44228 and do not have to upgrade again at this time. We have determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105, as the agents use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. We recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. Important If you are on a version of the agent earlier than 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable agent logging. How to disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter) (no restart is required) Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property (restart required) Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable (restart required) You can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Disabling the Java agent logging does not affect the functionality of the agent, and there will be no degradation in observability. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion.

Please implement the recommended workaround in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? Agent version information is displayed within the Environment page within your New Relic One dashboard. See our docs page for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the workaround outlined above. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already, do I need to update again? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, we recommend also disabling agent logging, as the fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in log4j v2.15.0. We recommend updating to at least the Java Agent 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against this critical vulnerability. While we have released newer Java Agents with log4j 2.17.0, we have determined that updating to 6.5.3 or 7.4.3 is not critical as New Relic's Java Agent is not susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105.

Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "Versions affected: All agent versions between (a) 4.12.0 and 6.5.1; and (b) 7.0.0 and 7.4.1 Fix versions: 6.5.2, 6.5.3, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3 Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 We have determined that the new vulnerability identified (CVE-2021-44832) does NOT affect New Relic's Java Agent, unless an additional attack vector would allow write permissions to the host system. In light of this finding, we have determined that no new Agent releases are needed to specifically mitigate this issue. Nonetheless, as part of its next planned release in January, the New Relic Java Agent will use the latest Apache version of log4j (currently version 2.17.1, which patches CVE-2021-44832). We have also determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT vulnerable to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105. This is because the agent's use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. However, we recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. As new versions of log4j become available, we will continue to release new versions of the agent. New Relic Java agent version Apache log4j version 6.5.1 2.15.0 6.5.2 2.12.2 6.5.3 2.12.3 7.4.1 2.15.0 7.4.2 2.16.0 7.4.3 2.17.0 Summary New Relic has released new versions of the Java agent to address critical vulnerabilities in the open source log4j framework that could allow a malicious actor to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java Agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 or higher (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 or higher (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible. If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, you are protected against CVE 2021-44228 and do not have to upgrade again at this time. We have determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105, as the agents use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. We recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. Important If you are on a version of the agent earlier than 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable agent logging. How to disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter) (no restart is required) Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property (restart required) Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable (restart required) You can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Disabling the Java agent logging does not affect the functionality of the agent, and there will be no degradation in observability. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 CVE-2021-45105 CVSS 7.5 CVE-2021-44832 CVSS 6.6 Security guidance for New Relic customers related to Apache Log4j vulnerabilities How to help identify systems with vulnerable log4j versions using New Relic Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement the recommended workaround in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? Agent version information is displayed within the Environment page within your New Relic One dashboard. See our docs page for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the workaround outlined above. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already, do I need to update again? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, we recommend also disabling agent logging, as the fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in log4j v2.15.0. We recommend updating to at least the Java Agent 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against this critical vulnerability. While we have released newer Java Agents with log4j 2.17.0, we have determined that updating to 6.5.3 or 7.4.3 is not critical as New Relic's Java Agent is not susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105.

      "body": "This document describes how New Relic protects the security of your data. For more information about our security measures, see our data privacy documentation and the New Relic Security website. Secured content Data for New Relic accounts are isolated so that users can only see the data for accounts they own (or have been given permission to see). New Relic also has certain rights regarding customers' data, described in the Terms and Conditions page on the New Relic website. Analytics In order to help us improve our product and user experience, New Relic uses third-party analytics services to better understand the behavior of users on our site. The user data that New Relic collects is used solely by New Relic and is not shared, sold, or rented to any third parties for their own use. For more information, see our Services data privacy notice. Data transmission and firewalls The New Relic agent communicates with two hosts: collector.newrelic.com collector-nnn.newrelic.com, where nnn is a numerical value Typically the numbered host is fixed for your account, and it appears in log/newrelic.agent.log. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Hosting and data storage New Relic is self-hosted with co-location services called Server Central in a Tier 3 data center in Chicago, Illinois and an IBM-hosted data center near Frankfurt, Germany, as well as cloud storage through Amazon AWS. We use standard best practices to maintain a firewall for our servers and to protect our servers from unauthorized login. All data is stored in a cluster of MySQL databases. New Relic data is backed up nightly, and an archive is stored at a secondary data center. Data access Access to account data by New Relic employees is limited to a necessary set of users consistent with their assigned New Relic responsibilities. Except to the extent necessary to provide subscribed services and as documented in our Services data privacy notice, customer account data is not shared with any third parties. All customer account data access is logged and regularly audited. HTTP parameters disabled by default By default, New Relic agents disable collection of HTTP request parameters, such as the query string of a URL. This is an automatic safeguard to protect potentially sensitive data. New Relic collects and displays HTTP parameters only when you explicitly enable them in your agent configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "Versions affected: All agent versions between (a) 4.12.0 and 6.5.1; and (b) 7.0.0 and 7.4.1 Fix versions: 6.5.2, 6.5.3, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3 Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 We have determined that the new vulnerability identified (CVE-2021-44832) does NOT affect New Relic's Java Agent, unless an additional attack vector would allow write permissions to the host system. In light of this finding, we have determined that no new Agent releases are needed to specifically mitigate this issue. Nonetheless, as part of its next planned release in January, the New Relic Java Agent will use the latest Apache version of log4j (currently version 2.17.1, which patches CVE-2021-44832). We have also determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT vulnerable to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105. This is because the agent's use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. However, we recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. As new versions of log4j become available, we will continue to release new versions of the agent. New Relic Java agent version Apache log4j version 6.5.1 2.15.0 6.5.2 2.12.2 6.5.3 2.12.3 7.4.1 2.15.0 7.4.2 2.16.0 7.4.3 2.17.0 Summary New Relic has released new versions of the Java agent to address critical vulnerabilities in the open source log4j framework that could allow a malicious actor to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java Agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 or higher (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 or higher (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible. If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, you are protected against CVE 2021-44228 and do not have to upgrade again at this time. We have determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105, as the agents use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. We recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. Important If you are on a version of the agent earlier than 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable agent logging. How to disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter) (no restart is required) Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property (restart required) Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable (restart required) You can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Disabling the Java agent logging does not affect the functionality of the agent, and there will be no degradation in observability. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 CVE-2021-45105 CVSS 7.5 CVE-2021-44832 CVSS 6.6 Security guidance for New Relic customers related to Apache Log4j vulnerabilities How to help identify systems with vulnerable log4j versions using New Relic Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement the recommended workaround in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? Agent version information is displayed within the Environment page within your New Relic One dashboard. See our docs page for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the workaround outlined above. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already, do I need to update again? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, we recommend also disabling agent logging, as the fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in log4j v2.15.0. We recommend updating to at least the Java Agent 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against this critical vulnerability. While we have released newer Java Agents with log4j 2.17.0, we have determined that updating to 6.5.3 or 7.4.3 is not critical as New Relic's Java Agent is not susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105.

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "Versions affected: All agent versions between (a) 4.12.0 and 6.5.1; and (b) 7.0.0 and 7.4.1 Fix versions: 6.5.2, 6.5.3, 7.4.2, and 7.4.3 Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 We have determined that the new vulnerability identified (CVE-2021-44832) does NOT affect New Relic's Java Agent, unless an additional attack vector would allow write permissions to the host system. In light of this finding, we have determined that no new Agent releases are needed to specifically mitigate this issue. Nonetheless, as part of its next planned release in January, the New Relic Java Agent will use the latest Apache version of log4j (currently version 2.17.1, which patches CVE-2021-44832). We have also determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT vulnerable to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105. This is because the agent's use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. However, we recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. As new versions of log4j become available, we will continue to release new versions of the agent. New Relic Java agent version Apache log4j version 6.5.1 2.15.0 6.5.2 2.12.2 6.5.3 2.12.3 7.4.1 2.15.0 7.4.2 2.16.0 7.4.3 2.17.0 Summary New Relic has released new versions of the Java agent to address critical vulnerabilities in the open source log4j framework that could allow a malicious actor to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java Agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 6.5.2 or higher (requires Java 7 or higher) or 7.4.2 or higher (requires Java 8 or higher) as soon as possible. If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, you are protected against CVE 2021-44228 and do not have to upgrade again at this time. We have determined that New Relic's Java Agent is NOT susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105, as the agents use of log4j sits behind a wrapper interface that does not use or support Thread Context Map input data, a required aspect of the vulnerability. We recommend updating to at least the 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against CVE-2021-44228. Important If you are on a version of the agent earlier than 6.5.2 or 7.4.2, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we strongly recommend you disable agent logging. How to disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter) (no restart is required) Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property (restart required) Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable (restart required) You can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Disabling the Java agent logging does not affect the functionality of the agent, and there will be no degradation in observability. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. We will share more information, and additional steps for remediation, if the situation changes. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions The above step will remediate your New Relic Java agent only. You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minion.

Technical vulnerability information CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 CVE-2021-45105 CVSS 7.5 CVE-2021-44832 CVSS 6.6 Security guidance for New Relic customers related to Apache Log4j vulnerabilities How to help identify systems with vulnerable log4j versions using New Relic Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement the recommended workaround in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? Agent version information is displayed within the Environment page within your New Relic One dashboard. See our docs page for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the workaround outlined above. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already, do I need to update again? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, we recommend also disabling agent logging, as the fix for CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in log4j v2.15.0. We recommend updating to at least the Java Agent 6.5.2 or 7.4.2 release to ensure comprehensive protection against this critical vulnerability. While we have released newer Java Agents with log4j 2.17.0, we have determined that updating to 6.5.3 or 7.4.3 is not critical as New Relic's Java Agent is not susceptible to either CVE-2021-45046 or CVE-2021-45105.

Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

      "body": "This document provides information on FedRAMP-compliant endpoints in New Relic. For more information about our security accreditation for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), see our data encryption documentation. For further information on New Relic networks, domains, and ports see our networking documentation. Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

Customer FedRAMP obligations New Relic customers must meet all of the following requirements for New Relic’s FedRAMP environment: New Relic-approved customers: New Relic’s FedRAMP-Moderate authorized environment is only available to New Relic-approved customers. For more information, contact your New Relic account representative. Order form: Customer’s order form with New Relic must include customer’s eligibility for FedRAMP. Subscription level: Customer must have a current and valid subscription to our Enterprise edition or a New Relic-approved subscription. Authorized New Relic endpoints: Customer must send its data only to New Relic’s FedRAMP-designated endpoints. Authorized services and features: Customer must use only FedRAMP audited and authorized New Relic services and features (see below). Overview of data sources There are multiple ways to get data into New Relic. This doc has two sections: Agent settings: for our APM agents, infrastructure agent, browser agent, and mobile agent. Data-ingest APIs: for our Metric API, Event API, Trace API, and Log API, and the integrations that use those APIs. Agents New Relic has several agents for reporting data, like our APM agents, infrastructure agents, mobile agents, and browser agent. Setting these agents to send FedRAMP-compliant data involves setting a configuration setting to use the relevant FedRAMP endpoint. APM agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance, all APM agent configurations must report to gov-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. Depending on the agent, you can either use code-based configuration or an environment variable. Here are details on enabling this: Language Code or environment variable C SDK In code: strcpy(_newrelic_app_config_t->redirect_collector, \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"); Copy Environment variable: none Go In code: app, err = newrelic.NewApplication( newrelic.ConfigAppName(\"App Name\"), newrelic.ConfigLicense(os.Getenv(\"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\")), func(cfg *newrelic.Config) { cfg.Host = \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" }, ) Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Java In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Or set a system property of: newrelic.config.host Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST .NET In your XML config next to the license key: <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" host=\"gov-collector.newrelic.com\"/> Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Node.js In newrelic.js: host: 'gov-collector.newrelic.com' Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST PHP In newrelic.ini: newrelic.daemon.collector_host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: none Python In newrelic.ini: [newrelic] host = gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Ruby In newrelic.yml: common: &default_settings host: gov-collector.newrelic.com Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST Elixir (open source agent) In config.exs: config :new_relic_agent, host: \"gov-collector.newrelic.com\" Copy Environment variable: NEW_RELIC_HOST For more on configuring APM agents, see APM configuration. Mobile monitoring agents To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using our mobile monitoring agents, all agent configurations must report to gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com rather than the default. You must use code-based configuration. Environment variables are not available. Framework-specific configurations: Agent Code or environment variable Android In code: NewRelic.withApplicationToken({APP_TOKEN}) .usingCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\") .usingCrashCollectorAddress(\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\") .start(this.getApplication()); Copy Environment variable: none iOS In code: [NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:@\"{APP_TOKEN}\" andCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-collector.newrelic.com\" andCrashCollectorAddress:@\"gov-mobile-crash.newrelic.com\"]; Copy Environment variable: none Infrastructure monitoring If you have infrastructure agent version 1.15.0 or higher, simply enable the FedRAMP configuration option. This enables FedRAMP compliancy for data reported by the infrastructure agent, and for any on-host integrations that work with the infrastructure agent to report data. Important The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is not currently FedRAMP compliant. If you have an older agent version, use the following values to edit your YAML configuration: Infrastructure agent versions below 1.15.0 If you have an infrastructure agent version below 1.15.0, you must change three of the endpoints used for reporting. To set these endpoints, you can change your YAML configuration or use environment variables. YAML config field Endpoint URL collector_url https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy identity_url https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy command_channel_url https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy To edit environment variables, use these values: Environment variable Endpoint URL NRIA_COLLECTOR_URL https://gov-infra-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_IDENTITY_URL https://gov-identity-api.newrelic.com Copy NRIA_COMMAND_CHANNEL_URL https://gov-infrastructure-command-api.newrelic.com Copy Browser agent Browser agents will automatically update your account information to use the correct endpoints. Data-ingest APIs Below are details about the FedRAMP endpoint for our ingest APIs: Metric API, the Event API, the Log API, and the Trace API. OTLP API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the OTLP API, instead of sending to the US OTLP API endpoint of https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317, send data to https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Metric API To ensure FedRAMP compliance when using the Metric API, instead of sending metric data to the default Metric API endpoint of https://metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1, it must be sent to https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1. The Metric API can be used directly but it's mainly used by various New Relic tools. Below are instructions showing where to edit the configuration for setting the FedRAMP endpoint. Telemetry integrations Here are instructions for our open source telemetry integrations that report metric data: Dropwizard: use the overrideUri configuration. Kamon: use the metric-ingest-url configuration. See Override endpoints. Micrometer: override the public String uri() method on your NewRelicRegistryConfig to return the new endpoint. See an example. Prometheus: Prometheus OpenMetrics: if you are using our nri-prometheus helm chart, you can change the endpoint in your values.yml file, like in this example. If you're using the nri-bundle chart, you need to nest this value under the nri-prometheus key to propagate it to the sub-chart. Caution The Prometheus remote write integration is not available for use with the https://gov-metric-api.newrelic.com/metric/v1 endpoint at this time and attempted requests will result in an HTTP 501 Not Implemented status code. Consider using the Prometheus OpenMetrics integration instead. Telemetry SDKs Here are instructions for our Telemetry SDKs that report metric data: Go: use the MetricsURLOverride configuration. Java: in the MetricBatchSender section, configure the endpoint. See an example. .NET: use the MetricUrlOverride configuration. Node.js: edit the METRIC_HOST = 'metric-api.newrelic.com' configuration. Python: edit the HOST = \"metric-api.newrelic.com\" configuration. Event API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for the Event API, all traffic reporting to insights-collector.newrelic.com must instead report to gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com. The Event API endpoint is configurable for the following Telemetry SDKs. The Telemetry SDKs are used by our open-source telemetry integrations. Language Solution Java Telemetry SDK In code: SenderConfiguration configuration = SenderConfiguration .builder( \"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\", EventBatchSender.EVENTS_PATH) .build(); EventBatchSender eventBatchSender = EventBatchSender.create(configuration); Copy Python Telemetry SDK In code: event_client = EventClient(host=\"gov-insights-collector.newrelic.com\") Copy For more information, see our Telemetry API documentation in GitHub. Log API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Log API, the solution for almost all our logging tools is to replace the https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 endpoint with https://gov-log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1. Here are details for various tools: Log forwarders Here are details on changing the endpoint for our log forwarders: AWS Firelens: Add the endpoint property to the options field of the logConfiguration, similar to to the EU account endpoint change shown in these Firelens endpoint configuration instructions. Fluentbit: Use our Fluentbit endpoint configuration. Fluentd: Use our Fluentd endpoint instructions. Infrastructure agent: See FedRAMP for infrastructure. Kubernetes: Our Kubernetes integration logs are based on fluentbit’s output plugin. Use these endpoint instructions. Logstash: Use our Logstash endpoint configuration. Syslog: For configuring syslog clients, see TCP endpoint configuration. S3: Not available. Vector: Not available. To use the Log API directly, you'd edit the Log API endpoint configuration. Trace API To ensure FedRAMP compliance for data sent via the Trace API (including telemetry integrations that use this API), replace the https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 endpoint with https://gov-trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1. Notes about FedRAMP compliance for other trace data: Trace data is reported by some of our agents, like our APM agents, browser agent, and mobile agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for that data, you would enable FedRAMP for the applicable agent. To enable FedRAMP compliance for Infinite Tracing, you would create a new FedRAMP compliant trace observer from the New Relic Edge app.",

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "New Relic takes your data privacy seriously. Our principles-based approach aims to go beyond the legal requirements for consent. We understand your concerns when you entrust us with your data, and we always strive to embrace your expectations and preferences. This document provides links to detailed information about the privacy and security measures we take to protect you and your customers' data privacy. Our monitoring tools are data-agnostic; they don't require sensitive materials, and many of them don't require any personal data. You are responsible for ensuring that your systems are appropriately set up and configured so that they don't send inappropriate personal data or sensitive materials to New Relic monitoring tools. For additional information about policies, credentials, audits, and other resources, see our New Relic security website. Tip New Relic now offers the option of HIPPA-enabled accounts for customers meeting certain requirements. To learn more, see HIPAA readiness at New Relic. Personal data transfer (Privacy Shield and SCC) The Schrems case ruling invalidates Privacy Shield. However, it explicitly reaffirms the validity of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) as an appropriate legal mechanism to transfer personal data outside of the European Union. You can find more information in How the Demise of Privacy Shield Affects Your New Relic Account. If you want to send personal data from the EU, we offer an appropriate data processing agreement (DPA) with SCC to govern the transfer of that data in accordance with the Schrems decision. For more information, consult our Data Processing Addendum FAQ, or download our pre-signed DPA (PDF|697 KB). Compliance with legal requirements We always strive to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and all relevant US State laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Our disk-based encryption provides additional security while your data is at rest (FIPS 140-2 compliant). In addition, we are authorized for Moderate Impact SaaS Services (FedRAMP Authorized Moderate) for accounts that meet specific criteria. For privacy-related details about New Relic's contractual and regulatory commitments for services, see: Terms of Service or Master Subscription Agreement Data Protection Agreement Services Privacy Notice For more information about annual audits, see Regulatory audits for New Relic services. Privacy by design and by default New Relic follows \"privacy by design\" principles as part of our overarching security program. For example, when New Relic agents capture a webpage or referrer URL, all query parameters are stripped by default. Here are examples of how we incorporate privacy considerations into our data and security practices. Personal data requests (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) New Relic strives to comply with all applicable laws as they take effect. This includes the European Union's GDPR and ePrivacy Directive and all applicable privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the US. For more information about our process when responding to requests to access or delete personal data, see New Relic personal data requests. Events and attributes You can query events and attributes, as well as create charts and alert conditions about this data. For a complete list of all events and attributes tracked by New Relic agents, see our data dictionary. Events and attributes example: If you use the Infrastructure ProcessSample event's commandLine attribute, by default we strip options and arguments from the full command line to prevent accidental leakage of sensitive information. Dropping data at ingest Dropping data gives you control over the data that you send to New Relic, including any personal data that you configured to be collected. By dropping specific events or attributes from events, you determine what data New Relic ultimately stores so that you can query, alert on, and analyze it. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. When our agents refer to data obfuscation, the agent actually removes the data before sending it to New Relic. The data cannot be recovered. For example, with APM queries, the Record SQL? value defaults to obfuscated. This strips the string literals and numeric sequences and then replaces them with the ? character. You can mask sensitive information in HTTP or HTTPS requests. For example, queries about distributed traces and transaction traces are obfuscated by default, in which case they cannot be recovered. For more information, see the documentation for specific New Relic services, including: APM transaction traces Distributed tracing Technical security controls We use a comprehensive set of technical controls to support general security needs as well as security for data we receive. For more information, see our documentation about data security, data encryption, and high security mode for APM agents. Organizational security controls New Relic maintains a number of internal policies and procedures to guide employees in privacy-related subjects such as data classification and handling, data retention, handling of personal data, fulfilling personal data requests, incident response, etc. All employees must complete the security and privacy training upon hiring and renew this training annually. Account security Our role-based account structure gives you direct control over who can access or change your account settings. For more information, see Users and roles. Retention of your data The New Relic One platform gives you a single source of truth for all your operational data, empowering you to ask and answer any question in milliseconds. This platform stores different types of data for different periods of time. The Data retention page in our UI provides information on how long your data will be stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). For more information, see Manage data retention. New Relic account emails By default, we communicate with you for a variety of purposes related to your status as New Relic subscribers. This includes product engagement, support, alert notifications, updates, billings, etc. Individual users can unsubscribe from certain communications. General email preferences are managed through the account user interface. For more information, see Account email settings. Alert notification emails are managed through the alerting UI. Account changes (NrAuditEvent) To view changes made to your account's users or to record configuration changes, query NrAuditEvent events. To be notified about account changes, create NRQL alert conditions. For more about available NrAuditEvent attributes, see our data dictionary. Account usage For more about usage, see Manage data. Security for products and services We publish security bulletins with detailed information about vulnerabilities, remediation strategies, and applicable updates for affected software. To receive notifications for future advisories, use either of these options: Subscribe to our security bulletins RSS feed. Select the Watching option in our Explorers Hub's Security notifications community channel to receive email alerts. The following summarizes how individual New Relic products and components ensure security, with links to additional details. Alerts and Applied Intelligence By default, our alerting services do not record any personal data. In addition, they automatically set default permissions for individual account users and access levels within account structures. For more information, see our documentation about Applied Intelligence, as well as our rules and limits for alerts. APIs APIs simply are interfaces for data exchange automation. APIs have no knowledge of the content being transferred. We require authorized users to provide their API keys to monitor subscription usage, manage account user permissions, query data, and perform other automated tasks. For more information, see Introduction to New Relic APIs. APM APM agents monitor your applications' performance. By default, APM agents do not record any personal data. For more information, see our APM security documentation. Browser monitoring Our browser monitoring agent allows you to monitor the performance of their websites. For more information, see: Browser security documentation Visitor's IP address New Relic cookies used by browser Enabling or disabling cookie collection for session tracking Diagnostics The New Relic Diagnostics service inspects relevant system information and any other necessary information (such as logs and config files) to perform diagnostic checks that assess configuration and operability. By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS. For more information, see the Diagnostics security documentation. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure agent allows you to monitor the performance of components in your ecosystem, such as servers, platforms, operating systems, databases, etc. Infrastructure may record the userID and username of users connecting to Infrastructure resources. For more information, see the security documentation for infrastructure monitoring. Integrations and serverless monitoring Our integrations services allow you to retrieve and load data into the New Relic database from a variety of sources, including: Cloud-based integrations On-host integrations in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes On-host integrations built by New Relic On-host integrations built by the open-source community On-host integrations built by you Depending on the integration, different types of data may be recorded so that you can monitor the integrations in New Relic. The integration services are data agnostic. They will have no knowledge of whether the imported data contains any personal information. For more information, see the documentation for the specific integration, including: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Kubernetes Microsoft Azure On-host integrations Serverless function monitoring Logs management Due to the nature of our logs management service, you have direct control over what data is reported to New Relic. To ensure data privacy and to limit the types of information New Relic receives, no customer data is captured except what you supply in your API calls or log forwarder configuration. All data for the logs service is then reported to New Relic over HTTPS. The logs service does mask number patterns that appear to be for items such as credit cards or Social Security numbers. For more information, see the Logs security documentation. Mobile monitoring By default, our mobile monitoring service collects two pieces of personal data: The IP address is used to derive high-level geographical data, and then is discarded. A device ID is generated by New Relic and is used for billing purposes. For more information, see our security documentation for mobile monitoring. Pixie auto-telemetry data Auto-telemetry with Pixie is New Relic One's integration of Community Cloud for Pixie, a managed version of Pixie open source software. The data that Pixie collects is stored entirely within your Kubernetes cluster. This data does not persist outside of your environment, and it will never be stored by Community Cloud for Pixie. This means that your sensitive data remains within your environment and control. For example, you can: Control who has access to your Pixie data. Manage auto-update and two-way communication. For more information, see our security documentation for auto-telemetry with Pixie data. Synthetic monitoring The synthetic monitoring service uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. It captures what is essentially performance data of simulated traffic. By default, it does not capture any personal data. For more information, see the data privacy and security documentation for synthetic monitoring. If you configure the synthetic service to monitor areas of websites that are located behind a login page, take care to create a non-personal login dedicated to this purpose. This will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. For example, to securely store sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and user names, you can use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The synthetic monitoring service also supports a variety of authentication mechanisms. Depending on the type of monitor you choose, this includes Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. You can also control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations. For more information, see our documentation about user role-based permissions.",

Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events.

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Azure AD-specific details on how to configure the New Relic Azure AD SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the requirements and procedure overview. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Azure's New Relic app Next, you'll set up Azure's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. Azure AD provides an application gallery, which includes various integrations for Azure AD, including the ones that New Relic offers. To set this up: Go to the Azure Active Directory admin center, and sign in if necessary. aad.portal.azure.com/ Click on All services in the left hand menu. In the main pane, click on Enterprise applications. Click on +New Application. Find our SCIM/SSO application by entering New Relic in the name search box, and click on the application New Relic by organization (not New Relic by account). Click on Add. Step 3. Configure connection Configure the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic. From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Provisioning link in the sidebar. In the main pane, click on Get started. In the Provisioning Mode pick-list, choose Automatic. In New Relic's authentication domain UI, set up a new domain with SCIM enabled. In Azure AD's New Relic SCIM/SSO app, in the Admin credentials section, fill out the Tenant URL and Secret token fields with the values provided in New Relic's authentication domain UI. To verify you can connect to New Relic, click Test Connection. When you see a message indicating verification success, click Save. The New Relic SCIM/SSO application can now connect with New Relic. Continue with the following section to configure the provisioning rules. Step 4. Configure provisioning rules Initially, nothing is configured to be sent to New Relic. You must configure Azure AD to send changes for user creation, updates, and deactivation. Go to the Provisioning page and complete the following: Expand the Mappings section. Click Provision Azure Active Directory Users. Verify the Target Object Actions Create Update and Delete checkboxes are all checked. Verify the Attribute Mappings look correct for your environment. Each of the New Relic attributes shown in the list must receive a value. Tip Ensure that the Azure Active Directory attributes shown in the list on the left are good sources for the information to send to New Relic. In particular, not all environments set the mail attribute. If your environment does not set the mail attribute, userPrincipalName could be a good alternative. Leave the switch for Enabled set to Off until you're done with the user and group configuration in the next section. Once all configuration is ready, return to this page and set the switch to On. Click Save. Here's an example of a filled-in attribute mapping page with the default values. Your values may be configured differently depending on your situation. After saving the provisioning rules, the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is ready to provision any changes made to users assigned to the application. Continue with the following section to assign users and groups to the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the Azure app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or SCIM provisioning today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. User assets include: Dashboards Favorites Weekly email settings Email opt in/out preferences User-specific user keys New Relic One apps NerdStorage data If a user has access to several organizations that use New Relic (for example, if that user is a contractor), their original user model record won't be fully deleted until all those organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will have both an original user record and one or more new user records and this will be displayed upon login (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more).

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or SCIM provisioning today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. User assets include: Dashboards Favorites Weekly email settings Email opt in/out preferences User-specific user keys New Relic One apps NerdStorage data If a user has access to several organizations that use New Relic (for example, if that user is a contractor), their original user model record won't be fully deleted until all those organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will have both an original user record and one or more new user records and this will be displayed upon login (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users.

      "body": "OpenTelemetry is a flexible toolkit that you can implement in a variety of ways. We recommend a basic four-step approach for setting up OpenTelemetry with New Relic. Here's an overview of the process, followed by details for each step. Prerequisites Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry Export your telemetry data to New Relic View your data in the New Relic UI Step 1. Prerequisites First things first: If we don’t already know you, sign up for a free New Relic account. Copy your account license key. Step 2. Instrument your service with OpenTelemetry To get started, you instrument your service with OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry has language-specific products and SDKs to help you. Many languages offer out-the-box instrumentation for common libraries and frameworks. Each language also provides an API for further instrumenting your service manually. Go to the repository for your language and follow the instructions to instrument your service. When you're done, return here to complete Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...See a complete list of languages in GitHub Step 3. Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes: Replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint, using the <hostname>:<port> format without http(s):// (for example, otlp.nr-data.net:4317). Replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key. export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector \\ --config otel-config.yaml Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI.

This guide provides OneLogin-specific details on how to configure the New Relic OneLogin SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up OneLogin's New Relic app Next, you'll be setting up OneLogin's New Relic SAML/SCIM app. To set this up: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click on Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Applications menu. From the OneLogin Applications page, click on Add App. In the search field on the OneLogin Find Applications page, enter \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and then click on the application when it shows in the search results. From the Add New Relic by Organization page, click on Save. Step 3. Configure SCIM/SSO application Configuration for the New Relic SCIM/SSO application is split across several forms. This section describes the different forms that need to be configured. From the New Relic by organization application page, fill in the following forms: Fill in the configuration form In the left pane, select Configuration and complete the following: Get the authentication domain ID (top of New Relic's authentication domain UI and SCIM bearer token (in authentication domain UI as \"SAML 2.0 endpoint) and input them into the appropriate fields in the OneLogin app. Leave the API Connection disabled until all the configuration described in the following sections is completed. After completing all the configuration, enable the connection. Fill in the rules form Configure the user groups to send to New Relic using rules. OneLogin provides this documentation which describes how to use rules to provision groups for users. Decide what type of groups to send along with your users to New Relic. If your organization is using Active Directory or LDAP, you might choose to use security groups to define your users capabilities at New Relic. Another reasonable group choice is OneLogin role. On the New Relic side, your user's groups define their capabilities. The groups that are sent with users will be mapped to New Relic capability groups. Note that at the moment, there is no way to delete a group from the OneLogin side. This is a known limitation from OneLogin. Removing or changing rules does not delete groups already sent to New Relic. If you wish to no longer use a group, removing all the users from the group will prevent it from being used at New Relic. A rule that only uses actions Here's an example rule configuration does not use any conditions. The conditions are left empty to avoid applying any filtering logic to the users. All users will be sent in this example. If you want to send only a subset of users, you need to specify conditions to select the subset. The actions describe where to retrieve the value for the group name and how to parse the value. In this example, we retrieve the group name from the OneLogin role field. The OneLogin role field only has a single value, but sometimes the source for the group name contains other fields besides group name. In other words, some sources give you a list of fields and values and only one of those fields has the value you want to use. In this case, you can insert a regular expression in with value that matches field to find and extract the value for the group name. This example uses the entire value of the For each field for the group name. Fill in the provisioning form In the left pane, select Provisioning and complete the following: Check Enable provisioning. Under Require admin approval before this action is performed, uncheck these options: Create user Delete user Update user Tip If you do not uncheck these options, SCIM provisioning requests will not be sent until an administrator approves them. Set When users are deleted in OneLogin, or the user's app access is removed, perform the below action to Delete. Set When user accounts are suspended in OneLogin, perform the following action to Suspend. Fill in the Parameters form In the left pane, select Parameters and complete the following: Click Groups field. Check Include in User Provisioning. Click Save. Save your changes After you complete the above forms, click Save. Then, return to the Configuration form and enable the API connection. Step 4. Assign users After New Relic SCIM/SSO application configuration is finished and New Relic side configuration is finished, you can begin to assign users to the application. Assign the New Relic SCIM/SSO application to a user: Go to the OneLogin web site and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the OneLogin home page, click Administration. From the OneLogin Administration page, choose the Users menu Users item. From the OneLogin Users page, click the user you want to assign the application to. From the user's page, click Applications. From the user's application page, click the plus sign and select the \"New Relic by Organization\" application. Important: Updating users' time zones is important, as charts and other user assets display times. Default is UMT. From the Edit New Relic by Organization login for user page, enter the user's time zone in IANA Time Zone database format (also known as the Olson time zone database format) and click Save. If you're using Roles to define your New Relic capability groups, from the user's application page, click the proper role(s) for the user and then click Save User. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Configure the OneLogin app to manage user type. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you should be able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO for your users, see the SAML instructions.",

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

Automation can make you faster, and it helps to eliminate fat-finger errors—and more importantly, it improves observability. You'll spend less time instrumenting systems, and reduce toil as your development ecosystem grows. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Measure code pipeline tutorial. 1. Make instrumentation part of every build Rolling instrumentation into your standard build process makes visibility the default, instead of being viewed as yet another burden on your developers. Modern build tools like Gradle can do almost anything; you can take advantage of that power to instrument your code quickly and efficiently. Tip Read this Best Practices post for more information about automating instrumentation in your pipeline Configuration management tools such as Terraform enable automation as well. Using the New Relic Terraform Provider, you can automatically add agents and alerts, or create a dashboard when you start up a new service. 2. Take advantage of CLI tools Most tools provide a command line interface that allows a back-door to quickly get work done. For example, the New Relic CLI lets you search and tag entities across accounts. The New Relic Lambda CLI installs and configures a New Relic AWS Lambda layer onto your AWS Lambda functions. You can also use the NR-1 CLI to build and share your own New Relic applications. 3. Leverage the power of APIs Now that you've instrumented your services, you can take advantage of New Relic's REST API to harvest information from your instrumentation and to manage your monitoring process. The New Relic API Explorer can help you to determine the cURL request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. The New Relic documentation includes a wealth of additional information on APIs that you can use to automate a number of important tasks, including: APIs to set up alert conditions APIs to define synthetic monitors APIs to create dashboards",

When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

MobileRequest MobileHandledException MobileRequestError MobileSession sessionCrashed A boolean value indicating whether or not that session crashed. MobileCrash MobileSession sessionDuration seconds (s) The length of time for which the user used the application in seconds. If the session crashes, sessionDuration is not captured (although other events and attributes are still recorded). For sessions longer than 10 minutes, events in the Interaction and Custom event categories are sent to Insights while the session is ongoing, and therefore do not have sessionDuration attributes. Events recorded near the end of the session will include the duration, as will the Session event category. MobileSession sessionId ID A unique identifier for a single user session. A new sessionId is created each time the app is brought into the foreground.

      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It's organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic. Install the nrlambda integration go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlambda. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our instrumentation examples: Extension repo Go agent repo Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: bash Copy $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Zip the binary into a deployment package using: bash Copy $ zip deployment.zip main Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public async Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return await new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); } public async Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> responseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> responseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: bash Copy $ npm install newrelic --save Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: bash Copy $ npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MyEventType', { foo: 'bar' }); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: bash Copy $ pip install -t . newrelic Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) ... Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

      "body": "High functioning DevOps teams use instrumentation to push changes to production more frequently and with less risk. This process yields important insights: How is your build pipeline performing? Where are the issues? They key is to instrument your pipeline in order to track it and to make improvements. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Establish team dashboards tutorial. 1. Identify what to track Look at your CI/CD system and determine the stats you'd like to gather. We recommend, at a minimum, starting with commit metadata, build status, test results, deploy status, and performance metrics. Determine which stats you want to report to New Relic. 2. Capture the events required to instrument your pipeline Capture timestamped state changes to your pipeline/CI/CD system indicating when a given stage started; and whether it succeeded or failed. This step, in turn, makes it easy to track your deployment process over time—looking for trends in the frequency of deployments, build quality, and other performance indicators. For easiest tracking, capture timestamped changes to your source code management system (SCM) with at least the author and a hash or unique change ID. Propagate this information wherever possible. If you have your own build system, add code to emit custom events at each stage. For hosted services, create a lightweight intermediary service/function-as-a-service (FaaS) to format and forward these custom events. The example below uses AWS CodePipeline to manage the flow of an application that is sourced in GitHub, built and tested with AWS CodeBuild, and deployed with Elastic Beanstalk. It utilizes a simple service written in Node.js, plus some \"glue code\" and event handlers needed to push data from GitHub and AWS to New Relic. Code for this example is available at github.com/newrelic/webinar. Use AWS CodePipeline to understand different parts of your flow. We chose the tools and products used here as examples—with the goal of illustrating the concepts around the types of data and events you should be thinking about when instrumenting your own code pipeline. The sample code, however, should be generic enough to adapt readily to almost any toolset.",

      "popularity": 1,
      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It's organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic. Install the nrlambda integration go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlambda. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our instrumentation examples: Extension repo Go agent repo Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: bash Copy $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Zip the binary into a deployment package using: bash Copy $ zip deployment.zip main Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public async Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return await new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); } public async Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> responseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> responseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: bash Copy $ npm install newrelic --save Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: bash Copy $ npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MyEventType', { foo: 'bar' }); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: bash Copy $ pip install -t . newrelic Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) ... Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations and quickstarts for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "popularity": 1,
      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It's organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic. Install the nrlambda integration go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlambda. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our instrumentation examples: Extension repo Go agent repo Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: bash Copy $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Zip the binary into a deployment package using: bash Copy $ zip deployment.zip main Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public async Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return await new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); } public async Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> responseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> responseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: bash Copy $ npm install newrelic --save Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: bash Copy $ npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MyEventType', { foo: 'bar' }); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: bash Copy $ pip install -t . newrelic Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) ... Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

You can always query them using NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE aws.Namespace='/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints' LIMIT MAX SINCE 1 WEEK AGO Copy Manual option Follow our docs to set up CloudWatch Metric Streams. Automated option You may automate the set up with the Terraform code: module \"example_usage\" { source = \"modules/nr-cloudwatch-metric-stream\" name_suffix = \"suffix\" # optional aws_account_id = \"your-aws-account-id\" newrelic_collector_endpoint = \"newrelic-endpoint-url\" newrelic_trusted_account_id = \"12345678\" newrelic_license_key = \"your-newrelic-license-key\" } Copy When calling the module, please write the correct newrelic_collector_endpoint: HTTP endpoint URL - US datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 When you set the metric stream you can choose to stream the metric from all the namespaces, or you can specify namespaces. Important You can view each entity's metrics in a dashboard that's created automatically when the metrics arrive at the New Relic. Monitor your data and model in Amazon SageMaker, and send the metrics to CloudWatch SageMaker automatically monitors your endpoints’ performance, and sends statistic metrics to CloudWatch. For more information, see Endpoint CloudWatch Metrics. To obtain more benefits from the Amazon SageMaker MLOps integration, use the Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor tools. You'll have to define scheduled monitoring jobs to monitor the quality of your machine learning models in production and send metrics to CloudWatch. The Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor provides the following types of monitoring: Monitor Data Quality: Monitor drift in data quality. Example notebook: Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/data-metrics Monitor Model Quality: Monitor drift in model quality metrics, such as accuracy. Example notebook: Amazon SageMaker Model Quality Monitor Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/model-metrics Monitor Bias Drift for Models in Production: Monitor bias in you model's predictions. Example notebook: Monitoring bias drift and feature attribution drift Amazon SageMaker Clarify Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/bias-metrics Monitor Feature Attribution Drift for Models in Production: Monitor drift in feature attribution. Example notebook: Monitoring bias drift and feature attribution drift Amazon SageMaker Clarify Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/explainability-metrics Advanced options You can aso publish metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch and define the namespaces and one of the above using the put_metric_data function. If you use your own algorithm for hyperparameter tuning, make sure that it sends at least one metric by writing evaluation data to stderr or stdout. Read more on how to define metrics in automatic model tuning. See also the example notebook Develop, Train, Optimize and Deploy Scikit-Learn Random Forest. Explore your MLOps entities and dashboards We generate aws-entities (under the MLOps entity domain) for the detailed namespaces. For these entities, you can get out-of-the-box dashboards and views. You can also create your own dashboard to view metrics that are not being displayed as part of the entities' views.

When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, Infrastructure will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It's organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic. Install the nrlambda integration go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlambda. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our instrumentation examples: Extension repo Go agent repo Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: bash Copy $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Zip the binary into a deployment package using: bash Copy $ zip deployment.zip main Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public async Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return await new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); } public async Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> responseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> responseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: bash Copy $ npm install newrelic --save Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: bash Copy $ npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MyEventType', { foo: 'bar' }); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: bash Copy $ pip install -t . newrelic Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) ... Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries.

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function.

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights.

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring. Next steps: Enable and use Lambda monitoring To get started using our Lambda monitoring, see the installation and enablement instructions.

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights.

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring.

Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes NodeJS: nodejs12.x, nodejs14.x Python: python3.7, python3.8, python3.9 Go: provided, provided.al2 Java: java8.al2, java11 .NET Core: dotnetcore3.1 AWS has older runtimes for these languages as well, but AWS has not chosen to support the latest Lambda APIs with those older runtimes. Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing telemetry off to the extension, the agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that Cloudwatch log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some other platform telemetry. In the past, we've seen that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service can generate a lot of data. If you're on the free tier, you may hit your data limit pretty quickly. If you're paying for data, you may find this service making up the largest share of the data you're sending to New Relic.",

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring.

The data displayed in the UI is a combination of these data sources. For example, the Overview page displays data reported by instrumentation, while the Metrics page displays CloudWatch data. Event definitions and attributes Lambda data is stored in our database (NRDB) as events (data objects with associated attributes). Lambda data is attached to the following event types. Select an event name to see its attributes. AwsLambdaInvocation event: Captures overall timing and associated metadata. A Lambda invocation generates a single AwsLambdaInvocation event. AwsLambdaInvocationError event: If an error occurs during a Lambda, this event will be generated. Span: This includes detail about a segment of a Lambda function. Spans are used for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing relies on data sampling; 10% of invocations are sampled to generate spans. Custom event types: With some agent APIs, custom events can be created and associated with a particular Lambda invocation, and then queried with NRQL. For more about limits on event storage, see Access and requirements.",

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes NodeJS: nodejs12.x, nodejs14.x Python: python3.7, python3.8, python3.9 Go: provided, provided.al2 Java: java8.al2, java11 .NET Core: dotnetcore3.1 AWS has older runtimes for these languages as well, but AWS has not chosen to support the latest Lambda APIs with those older runtimes. Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility. If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.",

Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can implement service levels for your applications, consume the results easily from the UI during your planning sessions and incident response, and progressively iterate on the configuration to adjust your objectives to the desired user experience. Besides the UI, you can also use our NerdGraph API Explorer to create and edit of SLIs and their SLOs. Alternatively, you can automate this configuration using the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create service levels, the API key needs a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Create an SLI with an SLO Please refer to Create and edit SLIs and SLOs to learn the basic concepts in the SLI and SLO configuration, such as the entity that an SLI is associated with. Also, you can refer to that documentation to find examples of the most common indicators for APM services and browser applications. The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates an SLI using the serviceLevelCreate mutation query: mutation { serviceLevelCreate( entityGuid: \"entityGuid\", indicator: { name: \"Latency below 0.25 seconds\", description: \"The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience.\", events: { validEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid'\" }, goodEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid' and duration < 0.25\" }, accountId: accountId}, objectives: { target: 99.5, timeWindow: { rolling: { count: 7, unit: DAY }}}}) { id description } } Copy It contains these fields: entityGuid: The GUID of the entity (for example, APM service, browser application, etc.) that you want to relate this SLI to. On the UI, you can find this GUID on the entity page, under See metadata and manage tags. description: Use detailed descriptions, including the selected threshold that determines good events. For example, for an availability SLI, include something like “The proportion of valid requests that were served without errors.” Or, for a latency SLI, include a description such as “The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience”. accountId: The ID of the account where the APM service or browser application belongs to, which contains the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations. badEvents.from, badEvents.where The NRQL query that defines bad events, SELECT count(*) FROM badEvents.from WHERE badEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and bad events, leave the goodEvents object empty. goodEvents.from, goodEvents.where The NRQL query that defines good events, SELECT count(*) FROM goodEvents.from WHERE goodEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and good events, leave the badEvents object empty. validEvents.from, validEvents.where These are the FROM and WHERE clauses for the NRQL query that defines valid events, which will result in SELECT count(*) FROM validEvents.from WHERE validEvents.where. name: A short category name for your SLI to help understand what the Service Level is about. We suggest including any specific parameters and filters involved in the SLI definition. Examples: Availability Latency below 4 seconds CLS for desktops below 0.1 objectives: An array of objectives (SLOs) for the SLI. target: The target for your SLO, up to 100.00. The field supports up to 5 decimals. If your users are happy with the current experience, set the SLO percentage to match the current baseline. For instance, the percentile used to determine the SLI's good events. timeWindow.rolling.count: The length of the period taken into consideration to calculate the SLO. The supported values are 1, 7, 14, 28, and 30. timeWindow.rolling.unit: DAYis the supported value. Retrieve the configuration of an SLI for an APM service Use this query to retrieve the configuration of an SLI, including its id. { actor { entity(guid: \"entityGuid\") { guid name serviceLevel { indicators { createdAt createdBy { email } description entityGuid id name objectives { target timeWindow { rolling { count unit } } } } } } } } Copy Update the SLOs of an SLI Use the serviceLevelUpdate mutation to define one or more SLOs for each one of the SLIs. To obtain the SLI's id, use the query above. mutation { serviceLevelUpdate( id: \"indicators.id\", indicator: { objectives: { target: 99.00, timeWindow: { rolling: { count: 7, unit: DAY }}}}) { id } } Copy",

To use New Relic's service levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service level management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's service levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap. How can I view the queries that define an SLI from the UI? To view the queries that define an SLI, you can click on the ... menu on the SLI summary card, then select the Edit option. The queries will show at the top-right corner. How can I view the queries that define an SLI through the API? To view the queries that define an SLI through the API, use Nerdgraph. In order to view the SLI configuration, you'll need to know the GUID of the entity the SLI is attached to, and replace it in the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { events { badEvents { where from } goodEvents { from where } validEvents { from where } } name } } } } } Copy As a response you are going to receive all the SLIs attached to the entity, the SLI name, and the queries. Keep in mind that either goodEvents or badEvents is going to have content, depending on the configuration of the SLI. Can I chart the SLI attainment on a dashboard? You can chart SLI attainment time series on your custom dashboards using the following query: FROM Metric SELECT clamp_max((count(newrelic.sli.valid) - count(newrelic.sli.bad)) / count(newrelic.sli.valid) * 100, 100) as 'SLI attainment' WHERE sli.id = '<sli.id>' UNTIL 2 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Where sli.id is the SLI identifier. The easiest way to add a chart like this to your dashboard is by using the Add to dashboard option, available on the Details view. Alternatively, you can find the SLI id and SLI attainment query through the Nerdgraph API with the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { name id resultQueries { indicator { nrql } } } } } } } Copy Use the entityGuid of the entity that's associated with the SLI. On the query results, you’ll get the SLI id in the serviceLevel.indicators.id field.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find service levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the service levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

With New Relic you can implement service levels for your applications, consume the results easily from the UI during your planning sessions and incident response, and progressively iterate on the configuration to adjust your objectives to the desired user experience. Besides the UI, you can also use our NerdGraph API Explorer to create and edit of SLIs and their SLOs. Alternatively, you can automate this configuration using the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create service levels, the API key needs a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Create an SLI with an SLO Please refer to Create and edit SLIs and SLOs to learn the basic concepts in the SLI and SLO configuration, such as the entity that an SLI is associated with. Also, you can refer to that documentation to find examples of the most common indicators for APM services and browser applications. The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates an SLI using the serviceLevelCreate mutation query: mutation { serviceLevelCreate( entityGuid: \"entityGuid\", indicator: { name: \"Latency below 0.25 seconds\", description: \"The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience.\", events: { validEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid'\" }, goodEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid' and duration < 0.25\" }, accountId: accountId}, objectives: { target: 99.5, timeWindow: { rolling: { count: 7, unit: DAY }}}}) { id description } } Copy It contains these fields: entityGuid: The GUID of the entity (for example, APM service, browser application, etc.) that you want to relate this SLI to. On the UI, you can find this GUID on the entity page, under See metadata and manage tags. description: Use detailed descriptions, including the selected threshold that determines good events. For example, for an availability SLI, include something like “The proportion of valid requests that were served without errors.” Or, for a latency SLI, include a description such as “The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience”. accountId: The ID of the account where the APM service or browser application belongs to, which contains the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations. badEvents.from, badEvents.where The NRQL query that defines bad events, SELECT count(*) FROM badEvents.from WHERE badEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and bad events, leave the goodEvents object empty. goodEvents.from, goodEvents.where The NRQL query that defines good events, SELECT count(*) FROM goodEvents.from WHERE goodEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and good events, leave the badEvents object empty. validEvents.from, validEvents.where These are the FROM and WHERE clauses for the NRQL query that defines valid events, which will result in SELECT count(*) FROM validEvents.from WHERE validEvents.where. name: A short category name for your SLI to help understand what the Service Level is about. We suggest including any specific parameters and filters involved in the SLI definition. Examples: Availability Latency below 4 seconds CLS for desktops below 0.1 objectives: An array of objectives (SLOs) for the SLI. target: The target for your SLO, up to 100.00. The field supports up to 5 decimals. If your users are happy with the current experience, set the SLO percentage to match the current baseline. For instance, the percentile used to determine the SLI's good events. timeWindow.rolling.count: The length of the period taken into consideration to calculate the SLO. The supported values are 1, 7, 14, 28, and 30. timeWindow.rolling.unit: DAYis the supported value.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. After you create your set of SLIs and SLOs, New Relic will start generating SLI data. The first results will take a few minutes to appear in the New Relic One UI. Find service levels: At the top nav bar, under Service Levels in the More menu (which you can customize). Here you can filter the SLIs by entity tags. At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. You can find them all around the UI. For instance, click on an entity from the Explorer's Navigator view. In APM services, at the reports section. In any workload that contains the SLI entity, such as an APM service or browser application. If you want to group SLIs under a certain workload, make sure to add the APM service or browser app to an existing workload, or create a new one. Click on any SLI to open the SLI card, which contains: The entity the SLI refers to, and the SLI name. Each row represents an SLO with: Target and time window. Compliance in the SLO period. Remaining requests error budget. Check your SLOs state Request-based SLOs are determined from SLIs defined as the ratio of the number of good responses to the total number of requests. This means a request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the goal for the SLO compliance period. If the SLO row has a green background, you’re doing good for the period. You may have not served successfully 100% of the requests, but you still have some remaining error budget to consume. If the SLO row has a yellow background, your error budget is closer to being totally consumed, and you should be more cautious for the rest of the period. If the SLO row has a red background, you’ve not reached the target SLO in this period, and you’ve consumed all of your error budget. Be careful if you need to deploy, and plan some work to improve your SLIs. You can click on the SLO to see more data about the entity, such as the golden metrics, the latest deployments, anomalies, and ongoing issues. This data can help you understand when and why you missed the SLO targets. You can define more than one SLO for the same SLI to check how fast you’re consuming the error budget. For instance, if you have an error budget of 0,1% requests for a whole week, you may not want to consume most of it in a single day, or the SLO will be at risk for the rest of the week. Understand service levels details We provide SLI details for two main purposes: For SLO analysis: See in which time ranges the SLO targets were missed. For SLI/SLO configuration and fine tuning: Learn how New Relic calculated SLO values. The SLI card contains the following charts: Good and bad responses These are the key concepts to analyze service levels: A valid request is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs. A good response is any response that you consider to provide a good experience (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user). A bad response is any response that you consider to provide a bad experience (like the service responded with a server error, interrupting the user's flow). This chart shows the total number of valid requests that your service received, broken down by good or bad. This chart shows the actual throughput of your service, which you can use to see if there’s any correlation between the increase of throughput and bad responses. SLI attainment over time (%) It's the proportion of what you consider good responses over time. The line should stay close to 100%, meaning that most requests were served successfully. Compliance over the period It's the ratio of good events (responses) to total events (requests), measured over the SLO compliance period. The closer to 100%, the closer your service is to meet the SLO target over the period. When this percentage goes below the SLO target, the chart will turn red: You need to put more effort in reliability. Remaining error budget (Requests) The error budget is an alternative way to read the SLO. It indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period, without compromising the objective. As the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the request throughput, New Relic shows the percentage of remaining error budget: As long as the remaining error budget is above 25%, you'll see green, and your SLO is good. When the error budget goes below 25%, it will turn yellow. This means you’re close to burning the whole budget for the period. You may want to be more careful with new deployments and changes, and plan for some reliability work. Once the error budget is completely spent, it will show in red. SLI attainment over time and SLO target (%) The last chart shows two time series: the (SLI attainment over time) [#sli-over-time] , and the SLO target. When the SLI value is below the SLO target,your service is missing the SLO. Use this chart to learn in which time ranges your service missed the SLO target. Analyze bad responses When an SLO is not compliant, you need to analyze the original data to better understand what the impact is for your customer, with a special focus on what went wrong. At the Service Levels page, click the ... menu in any SLI and select Analyze. You'll access the query that represents the original NRDB events used to determine the bad responses which calculate the SLI attainment. You can then use the query builder to facet and filter down the unsuccessful responses by user account, client id, requesting source, etc. to better understand the cause and impact of missing your SLIs.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find service levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the service levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

Alternatively, you can automate the process with our NerdGraph API and the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create service levels you need a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Key concepts to create SLIs and SLOs Keep in mind these concepts when defining SLIs and SLOs. The SLI entity In the New Relic ecosystem, SLIs and SLOs are linked to entities, which are all the elements in your stack that report data to us, or that generate data that we have access to. The entity that an SLI is related to determines where the SLI/SLO results show. And the entity's tags help filter down SLI results on the service levels view. You can define SLIs on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, and therefore you can also base SLIs on custom events. Most custom events are not related to a single New Relic entity, but provide higher level business and user experience insights. In this case, you can still relate the SLI to a specific entity or to a workload. SLI queries SLIs are defined as the percentage of good responses out of the total number of valid requests. Most often you’ll set up your SLIs by defining the valid and good pieces: A valid request is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs (for example, all transactions related to an endpoint that weren’t initiated by a health check). A good response is any response that you consider to provide a good output for the end-user or client service (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user). Alternatively, you can define what you consider to be the bad responses instead: A bad response is any response that you consider to provide a bad output (for example, the service responded with a server error, causing the client to fail its flow). New Relic will automatically derive the count of good responses as valid - bad. Request-based SLOs are based on an SLI defined as the ratio of the number of good requests to the total number of requests. A request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the goal for the compliance period. Suggested SLIs In this section you’ll find some SLIs that are typically used to measure the performance of services and browser applications. SLIs for APM services instrumented with the New Relic agent Based on Transaction events, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services: Service availability Service availability is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors. Valid events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Bad events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND error IS TRUE Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Service latency A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience. In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance. To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the query builder, and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI: select percentile(duration, 95) from Transaction where entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max Valid events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and duration < {duration} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Where {duration} is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds. SLIs for APM services instrumented with OpenTelemetry Based on OpenTelemetry spans, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services: Service availability Service availability is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors. Valid events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Bad events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND otel.status_code = 'ERROR' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Service latency A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience. In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance. To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the query builder, and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI: select percentile(duration.ms, 95) from Span where entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) since 7 days ago limit max Valid events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND duration.ms < {duration} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Where {duration} is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds. SLIs for browser applications The following SLIs are based on Google’s Browser Core Web Vitals. Browser app largest contentful paint It’s the proportion of valid page views where the largest content element visible in the viewport was rendered faster than the threshold considered to correspond to a good experience. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and largestContentfulPaint<'{largestContentfulPaint}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {largestContentfulPaint} is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to render the largest content element visible in the viewport that you consider provides a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 4000 ms. To determine a realistic number to use for {largestContentfulPaint} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile (largestContentfulPaint,95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max Browser app first input delay It’s the proportion of page views where the time between a user's first interacion with the page and the time when the browser responds to that interaction is less than a certain threshold. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and firstInputDelay<{firstInputDelay} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {firstInputDelay} is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the browser should respond in to provide a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 300 ms. To determine a realistic number to use for {firstInputDelay} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile(firstInputDelay,95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType Browser app cumulative layout shift It’s the proportion of page views with a good cumulative layout shift (CLS). CLS is described as the total sum of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. If you’d like to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately, add one of these clauses at the end of the field: and deviceType = 'Mobile' and deviceType = 'Desktop' Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and cumulativeLayoutShift < {cumulativeLayoutShift} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {cumulativeLayoutShift} is a pre-set value. To provide a good user experience, your site should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. A CLS score of 0.25 or more is considered a poor user experience. If you’ve decided to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately when you defined the valid events query, add this clause at the end of the field: and deviceType = 'Mobile' and deviceType = 'Desktop' To determine a realistic number to select for {cumulativeLayoutShift} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 75th percentile of page loads for the last 7 or 15 days, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile(cumulativeLayoutShift,75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType Create and edit service levels To create SLIs and SLOs, go to the Service Levels tab at any workload in New Relic One and follow these steps: Select the SLI data source In order to define your new SLI, choose one of these two options: Entity data: Base the SLI on standard data coming from New Relic One agents. This is the most common option. If this is your choice, select the entity (for example, APM service) you want to use. Custom data: Alternatively, you can base the SLI on your custom NRDB events. Use this option when you can't relate the service level data to a specific entity, or when you want to relate the service level directly to a workload. Configure the queries The account where the data is gathered from matches the account of the entity that the SLI refers to. The rest of the fields correspond to the NRDB event that goes into the FROM clause, as well as the WHERE clauses that determine what is a valid and a good/bad event. Please see the section above to know what goes into each field. On the left you’ll see the final queries; and at the bottom you’ll get a preview of the count of valid and good/bad events in the last month. Important SLI queries support NRDB events, but not dimensional metrics yet. Set the SLO time window and target In this step you’ll get a preview of the SLI value. You can add one or more SLOs for this SLI. Just select the length of the time window and the percentage target. The chart on the left will help you anticipate whether the target you’re setting is feasible or if it's often missed. Rolling time-window SLOs are supported. With a rolling time-window, the SLO compliance takes into account the last N days. Every minute, the oldest data drops out of the current calculation and new data replaces it.

With New Relic you can implement service levels for your applications, consume the results easily from the UI during your planning sessions and incident response, and progressively iterate on the configuration to adjust your objectives to the desired user experience. Besides the UI, you can also use our NerdGraph API Explorer to create and edit of SLIs and their SLOs. Alternatively, you can automate this configuration using the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create service levels, the API key needs a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Create an SLI with an SLO Please refer to Create and edit SLIs and SLOs to learn the basic concepts in the SLI and SLO configuration, such as the entity that an SLI is associated with. Also, you can refer to that documentation to find examples of the most common indicators for APM services and browser applications. The following is an example NerdGraph call that creates an SLI using the serviceLevelCreate mutation query: mutation { serviceLevelCreate( entityGuid: \"entityGuid\", indicator: { name: \"Latency below 0.25 seconds\", description: \"The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience.\", events: { validEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid'\" }, goodEvents: { from: \"Transaction\", where: \"entityGuid = 'entityGuid' and duration < 0.25\" }, accountId: accountId}, objectives: { target: 99.5, timeWindow: { rolling: { count: 7, unit: DAY }}}}) { id description } } Copy It contains these fields: entityGuid: The GUID of the entity (for example, APM service, browser application, etc.) that you want to relate this SLI to. On the UI, you can find this GUID on the entity page, under See metadata and manage tags. description: Use detailed descriptions, including the selected threshold that determines good events. For example, for an availability SLI, include something like “The proportion of valid requests that were served without errors.” Or, for a latency SLI, include a description such as “The proportion of valid requests that were served faster than 0.25s, which is considered to correspond to a good experience”. accountId: The ID of the account where the APM service or browser application belongs to, which contains the NRDB data for the SLI/SLO calculations. badEvents.from, badEvents.where The NRQL query that defines bad events, SELECT count(*) FROM badEvents.from WHERE badEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and bad events, leave the goodEvents object empty. goodEvents.from, goodEvents.where The NRQL query that defines good events, SELECT count(*) FROM goodEvents.from WHERE goodEvents.where, requires these FROM and WHERE clauses. If you defined an SLI from valid and good events, leave the badEvents object empty. validEvents.from, validEvents.where These are the FROM and WHERE clauses for the NRQL query that defines valid events, which will result in SELECT count(*) FROM validEvents.from WHERE validEvents.where. name: A short category name for your SLI to help understand what the Service Level is about. We suggest including any specific parameters and filters involved in the SLI definition. Examples: Availability Latency below 4 seconds CLS for desktops below 0.1 objectives: An array of objectives (SLOs) for the SLI. target: The target for your SLO, up to 100.00. The field supports up to 5 decimals. If your users are happy with the current experience, set the SLO percentage to match the current baseline. For instance, the percentile used to determine the SLI's good events. timeWindow.rolling.count: The length of the period taken into consideration to calculate the SLO. The supported values are 1, 7, 14, 28, and 30. timeWindow.rolling.unit: DAYis the supported value.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. What permissions do I need to use New Relic's service levels? To use New Relic's service levels and see SLO results, you need a full platform user. However, in order to create new SLIs and SLOs, you need the specific capability in your role to modify events to metric rules. If you get the following errors, check your user permissions: The UI has disabled the option to save an SLI/SLO. The API returns the error message “Cannot query field \\\"eventExportRegisterRule\\\" on type \\\"RootMutationType\\\".”. How do I get support from New Relic during the public beta? Service level management is in public beta, and no official support is offered yet through the Support portal. If you have general questions and feedback, please post them on the Explorers Hub. New Relic’s community and the product team will be glad to help you there. If you have suggestions about documentation, please suggest an improvement or send your contribution using the Create issue or Edit page buttons on the top right corner in the docs UI. Why don’t I see any data right after I create an SLI? New Relic starts generating new SLI metrics from the moment that you create an SLI. This is why we need a few minutes before we can start showing the first meaningful SLI attainment results. The benefit of the new data is that it has 13 month retention by default, and it’s more efficient to query for long periods of time. Can I configure an SLI on any entity type? Yes, you can configure an SLI on any entity type, such as an APM service, a browser application, or a Lambda function. SLI queries support NRDB events. Support for dimensional metrics on SLI queries is on our roadmap. Can I get alerts on SLI data? Alerts on New Relic's service levels are on our roadmap. How does New Relic calculate the remaining error budget? The remaining error budget indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period without compromising the objective. Therefore, the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the throughput of requests. Time-based error budgets are on our roadmap. How can I view the queries that define an SLI from the UI? To view the queries that define an SLI, you can click on the ... menu on the SLI summary card, then select the Edit option. The queries will show at the top-right corner. How can I view the queries that define an SLI through the API? To view the queries that define an SLI through the API, use Nerdgraph. In order to view the SLI configuration, you'll need to know the GUID of the entity the SLI is attached to, and replace it in the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { events { badEvents { where from } goodEvents { from where } validEvents { from where } } name } } } } } Copy As a response you are going to receive all the SLIs attached to the entity, the SLI name, and the queries. Keep in mind that either goodEvents or badEvents is going to have content, depending on the configuration of the SLI. Can I chart the SLI attainment on a dashboard? You can chart SLI attainment time series on your custom dashboards using the following query: FROM Metric SELECT clamp_max((count(newrelic.sli.valid) - count(newrelic.sli.bad)) / count(newrelic.sli.valid) * 100, 100) as 'SLI attainment' WHERE sli.id = '<sli.id>' UNTIL 2 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Where sli.id is the SLI identifier. The easiest way to add a chart like this to your dashboard is by using the Add to dashboard option, available on the Details view. Alternatively, you can find the SLI id and SLI attainment query through the Nerdgraph API with the following query: { actor { entity(guid: \"{entityGuid}\") { serviceLevel { indicators { name id resultQueries { indicator { nrql } } } } } } } Copy Use the entityGuid of the entity that's associated with the SLI. On the query results, you’ll get the SLI id in the serviceLevel.indicators.id field.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. After you create your set of SLIs and SLOs, New Relic will start generating SLI data. The first results will take a few minutes to appear in the New Relic One UI. Find service levels: At the top nav bar, under Service Levels in the More menu (which you can customize). Here you can filter the SLIs by entity tags. At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. You can find them all around the UI. For instance, click on an entity from the Explorer's Navigator view. In APM services, at the reports section. In any workload that contains the SLI entity, such as an APM service or browser application. If you want to group SLIs under a certain workload, make sure to add the APM service or browser app to an existing workload, or create a new one. Click on any SLI to open the SLI card, which contains: The entity the SLI refers to, and the SLI name. Each row represents an SLO with: Target and time window. Compliance in the SLO period. Remaining requests error budget. Check your SLOs state Request-based SLOs are determined from SLIs defined as the ratio of the number of good responses to the total number of requests. This means a request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the goal for the SLO compliance period. If the SLO row has a green background, you’re doing good for the period. You may have not served successfully 100% of the requests, but you still have some remaining error budget to consume. If the SLO row has a yellow background, your error budget is closer to being totally consumed, and you should be more cautious for the rest of the period. If the SLO row has a red background, you’ve not reached the target SLO in this period, and you’ve consumed all of your error budget. Be careful if you need to deploy, and plan some work to improve your SLIs. You can click on the SLO to see more data about the entity, such as the golden metrics, the latest deployments, anomalies, and ongoing issues. This data can help you understand when and why you missed the SLO targets. You can define more than one SLO for the same SLI to check how fast you’re consuming the error budget. For instance, if you have an error budget of 0,1% requests for a whole week, you may not want to consume most of it in a single day, or the SLO will be at risk for the rest of the week. Understand service levels details We provide SLI details for two main purposes: For SLO analysis: See in which time ranges the SLO targets were missed. For SLI/SLO configuration and fine tuning: Learn how New Relic calculated SLO values. The SLI card contains the following charts: Good and bad responses These are the key concepts to analyze service levels: A valid request is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs. A good response is any response that you consider to provide a good experience (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user). A bad response is any response that you consider to provide a bad experience (like the service responded with a server error, interrupting the user's flow). This chart shows the total number of valid requests that your service received, broken down by good or bad. This chart shows the actual throughput of your service, which you can use to see if there’s any correlation between the increase of throughput and bad responses. SLI attainment over time (%) It's the proportion of what you consider good responses over time. The line should stay close to 100%, meaning that most requests were served successfully. Compliance over the period It's the ratio of good events (responses) to total events (requests), measured over the SLO compliance period. The closer to 100%, the closer your service is to meet the SLO target over the period. When this percentage goes below the SLO target, the chart will turn red: You need to put more effort in reliability. Remaining error budget (Requests) The error budget is an alternative way to read the SLO. It indicates what percentage of requests could still have a bad response over the SLO period, without compromising the objective. As the total amount of tolerated bad responses will vary with the request throughput, New Relic shows the percentage of remaining error budget: As long as the remaining error budget is above 25%, you'll see green, and your SLO is good. When the error budget goes below 25%, it will turn yellow. This means you’re close to burning the whole budget for the period. You may want to be more careful with new deployments and changes, and plan for some reliability work. Once the error budget is completely spent, it will show in red. SLI attainment over time and SLO target (%) The last chart shows two time series: the (SLI attainment over time) [#sli-over-time] , and the SLO target. When the SLI value is below the SLO target,your service is missing the SLO. Use this chart to learn in which time ranges your service missed the SLO target. Analyze bad responses When an SLO is not compliant, you need to analyze the original data to better understand what the impact is for your customer, with a special focus on what went wrong. At the Service Levels page, click the ... menu in any SLI and select Analyze. You'll access the query that represents the original NRDB events used to determine the bad responses which calculate the SLI attainment. You can then use the query builder to facet and filter down the unsuccessful responses by user account, client id, requesting source, etc. to better understand the cause and impact of missing your SLIs.",

Alternatively, you can automate the process with our NerdGraph API and the Terraform Service Level resource. Important In order to create service levels you need a role with permissions to modify and delete metric rules. Key concepts to create SLIs and SLOs Keep in mind these concepts when defining SLIs and SLOs. The SLI entity In the New Relic ecosystem, SLIs and SLOs are linked to entities, which are all the elements in your stack that report data to us, or that generate data that we have access to. The entity that an SLI is related to determines where the SLI/SLO results show. And the entity's tags help filter down SLI results on the service levels view. You can define SLIs on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, and therefore you can also base SLIs on custom events. Most custom events are not related to a single New Relic entity, but provide higher level business and user experience insights. In this case, you can still relate the SLI to a specific entity or to a workload. SLI queries SLIs are defined as the percentage of good responses out of the total number of valid requests. Most often you’ll set up your SLIs by defining the valid and good pieces: A valid request is any request that you want to count as meaningful for your SLIs (for example, all transactions related to an endpoint that weren’t initiated by a health check). A good response is any response that you consider to provide a good output for the end-user or client service (for example, the service responded in less than 2 seconds, providing a good navigation experience for the end user). Alternatively, you can define what you consider to be the bad responses instead: A bad response is any response that you consider to provide a bad output (for example, the service responded with a server error, causing the client to fail its flow). New Relic will automatically derive the count of good responses as valid - bad. Request-based SLOs are based on an SLI defined as the ratio of the number of good requests to the total number of requests. A request-based SLO is met when that ratio meets or exceeds the goal for the compliance period. Suggested SLIs In this section you’ll find some SLIs that are typically used to measure the performance of services and browser applications. SLIs for APM services instrumented with the New Relic agent Based on Transaction events, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services: Service availability Service availability is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors. Valid events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Bad events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND error IS TRUE Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Service latency A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience. In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance. To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the query builder, and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI: select percentile(duration, 95) from Transaction where entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max Valid events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: Transaction WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and duration < {duration} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Where {duration} is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds. SLIs for APM services instrumented with OpenTelemetry Based on OpenTelemetry spans, these SLIs are the most common for request-driven services: Service availability Service availability is the ratio of the number of successful responses to the number of all requests. This effectively is an error rate, but you can filter it down, for example removing expected errors. Valid events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Bad events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND otel.status_code = 'ERROR' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Service latency A latency SLI measures the proportion of valid requests that were served faster than the threshold established as a good experience. In order to determine that duration threshold, check how the service has been performing in the past weeks, and use that result as a realistic and achievable baseline. Afterwards, you can iterate on the SLI threshold, and align it with a more ambitious performance. To select an appropriate value for the duration condition, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find this duration threshold using the query builder, and use it to determine what you consider to be good events for your SLI: select percentile(duration.ms, 95) from Span where entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) since 7 days ago limit max Valid events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: Span WHERE: entity.guid = '{entityGuid}' AND (span.kind IN ('server', 'consumer') OR kind IN ('server', 'consumer')) AND duration.ms < {duration} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Where {duration} is the response time that you consider provides a good experience for your client service or end-user, in seconds. SLIs for browser applications The following SLIs are based on Google’s Browser Core Web Vitals. Browser app largest contentful paint It’s the proportion of valid page views where the largest content element visible in the viewport was rendered faster than the threshold considered to correspond to a good experience. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and largestContentfulPaint<'{largestContentfulPaint}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {largestContentfulPaint} is the amount of time (in milliseconds) to render the largest content element visible in the viewport that you consider provides a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 4000 ms. To determine a realistic number to use for {largestContentfulPaint} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile (largestContentfulPaint,95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max Browser app first input delay It’s the proportion of page views where the time between a user's first interacion with the page and the time when the browser responds to that interaction is less than a certain threshold. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and firstInputDelay<{firstInputDelay} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {firstInputDelay} is the amount of time (in milliseconds) the browser should respond in to provide a good experience for your end user. A frequent standard is 300 ms. To determine a realistic number to use for {firstInputDelay} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 95 percentile duration of the responses for the last 7 or 15 days. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile(firstInputDelay,95) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType Browser app cumulative layout shift It’s the proportion of page views with a good cumulative layout shift (CLS). CLS is described as the total sum of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. A layout shift occurs any time a visible element changes its position from one rendered frame to the next. Valid events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' Copy Where {entityGuid} is the service's GUID. If you’d like to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately, add one of these clauses at the end of the field: and deviceType = 'Mobile' and deviceType = 'Desktop' Good events fields FROM: PageViewTiming WHERE: entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' and cumulativeLayoutShift < {cumulativeLayoutShift} Copy Where {entityGuid} is the browser app GUID. Where {cumulativeLayoutShift} is a pre-set value. To provide a good user experience, your site should strive to have a CLS score of 0.1 or less. A CLS score of 0.25 or more is considered a poor user experience. If you’ve decided to create separate SLIs to track CLS in desktop and mobile devices separately when you defined the valid events query, add this clause at the end of the field: and deviceType = 'Mobile' and deviceType = 'Desktop' To determine a realistic number to select for {cumulativeLayoutShift} in your environment, one typical practice is to select the 75th percentile of page loads for the last 7 or 15 days, segmented across mobile and desktop devices. Find it by using the query builder: SELECT percentile(cumulativeLayoutShift,75) FROM PageViewTiming WHERE entityGuid = '{entityGuid}' since 7 days ago limit max facet deviceType Create and edit service levels To create SLIs and SLOs, go to the Service Levels tab at any workload in New Relic One and follow these steps: Select the SLI data source In order to define your new SLI, choose one of these two options: Entity data: Base the SLI on standard data coming from New Relic One agents. This is the most common option. If this is your choice, select the entity (for example, APM service) you want to use. Custom data: Alternatively, you can base the SLI on your custom NRDB events. Use this option when you can't relate the service level data to a specific entity, or when you want to relate the service level directly to a workload. Configure the queries The account where the data is gathered from matches the account of the entity that the SLI refers to. The rest of the fields correspond to the NRDB event that goes into the FROM clause, as well as the WHERE clauses that determine what is a valid and a good/bad event. Please see the section above to know what goes into each field. On the left you’ll see the final queries; and at the bottom you’ll get a preview of the count of valid and good/bad events in the last month. Important SLI queries support NRDB events, but not dimensional metrics yet. Set the SLO time window and target In this step you’ll get a preview of the SLI value. You can add one or more SLOs for this SLI. Just select the length of the time window and the percentage target. The chart on the left will help you anticipate whether the target you’re setting is feasible or if it's often missed. Rolling time-window SLOs are supported. With a rolling time-window, the SLO compliance takes into account the last N days. Every minute, the oldest data drops out of the current calculation and new data replaces it. Define your SLI Select a short name for your SLI that helps you recognize what it’s measuring. Optionally, you may add a description. Edit SLIs After you’ve created an SLI, access the UI and click on the ... menu to edit it:",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "Tables help you organize information to make it easier for readers to skim. However, if your table becomes too long, follow the \"five to nine\" guideline and consider restructuring the information in other ways. Use sentence case for text in every table column unless it's a specific file name or code value that requires lower case or all caps. Table template This is a basic table template. <table> <thead> <tr> <th style={{ width: \"200px\" }}> Item </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Item name </td> <td> Description of item </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Additional options: If you want to...

In general, for two-column tables on the docs site: Set the first column as 200 pixels: <th style=\"width:200px\">. To allow the table to adjust automatically to the remaining page width, do not set a width for the second column. Tables to describe UI functions When using tables to describe available functions, give readers a roadmap.

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Lists are a powerful way to organize information, but they don't always make for a pleasant reading experience. Keep these points in mind when you're writing a list: Always capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item. Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step procedures, where the order matters. Use unordered (bulleted) lists to make it easier for users to skim related information. Use OR on a separate line when there is more than one option for a numbered step or a bullet point. Use tables when your ordered or unordered list would benefit from some extra detail. Tip For punctuation guidelines, follow the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, which includes considerations for localization. Here's an example of an ordered list as a table. Because each step is a row, the table helps to structure the levels of detail. In-line lists As an alternative to using bullet point lists, you can do an in-line list, like this: C SDK | Go | Java. You might want to use an in-line list when: You're linking to further documentation. Customers will likely be selecting a single option. The list item can be displayed with a short word or phrase (like Java, or Infrastructure). You think a bullet point list takes up a lot of vertical space. This may happen in circumstances where a procedure must include several lists. Here's one example of this. There are only two or three potential options they'll be choosing from and a bullet point list seems unnecessary. Here's an example.",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

In general, for two-column tables on the docs site: Set the first column as 200 pixels: <th style=\"width:200px\">. To allow the table to adjust automatically to the remaining page width, do not set a width for the second column.

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. The following table provides some examples of our use of code format. For this... Example Command line utility names To install the utility, use apt. File paths and file names The agent looks for newrelic.config in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent directory. Insights event names and attributes To analyze APM errors, use the TransactionError event. Method names To initialize the APM agent, use startAgent(). Non-clickable URLs In your web browser, navigate to the minion Overview page at http://MINION_IP_ADDRESS. The <var> formatting automatically applies color coding and italics in this situation. These sections break down when to use specific types of code formatting. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc. Formatting terminal commands If you have sentences that mention single-word system commands, surround these words in code tags (Markdown uses backticks ` for this) so translators don't confuse these words with words in general usage. Here are some words that translators or readers could confuse: curl: Sends http requests via a terminal session–not to be confused with the curls you do with weights at the gym. cat: Lists the first ten lines of a file–not a feline pet who ignores you. date: Displays the day, year, and time–not an outing that couples take. tail: Displays the last ten lines of a file–not the appendage on various mammals. which: Show the location of a program executable–not the pronoun. The moral of the story: If you think a reader or translator might confuse a command with a general English word, just enclose it in backticks (`).",

When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, the folder/file structure, and more. For brief instructions for common use cases, see Procedures, but if you're doing larger docs site projects, it's recommended you understand the general concepts beforehand. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Doc files: All the docs are represented by .mdx files, also known as markdown files. Nav files: The nav files are what govern the displayed structure of the docs site, as exposed in the docs site left sidebar. The nav files are yaml files located in the nav directory. Folder: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content directory). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar structure is determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or sub-category: we use these words fairly interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, we might refer to the \"Accounts\" category, or the \"Manage data\" category. Auto-index pages (deprecated): This refers to a previous implementation where users could load views of the docs in a specific category (for example, by clicking a category heading in the sidebar). We no longer support this implementation. Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure in the sidebar. The displayed structure seen in the sidebar is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the structure displayed in the sidebar without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely equivalent. Because these two things are separate, this can mean that there can be some unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes. This means that when you move a doc file, you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL. This means you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls the displayed structure of docs you see in the sidebar. Currently there are multiple nav files, one for each major section of docs. For example, there's a nav file for \"Accounts\", which contains organization- and account-related settings. And there's a nav file for \"Infrastructure monitoring.\" For more on nav file format, see Nav file format What governs how a sidebar displays? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure (which is governed by the nav files) is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL across all the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. A doc's URL may exist in more than one nav file. Currently, it's a rule that a doc can only be located in one place across all nav files. But we still have some docs that exist in multiple nav files. For those cases, our site attempts to find the appropriate nav file by choosing the nav file that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with the relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents pages: - title: Agent data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc. Each nav file's top level title also has a path. Do not use trailing slashes. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. If you're doing a larger docs project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the general docs site structure concepts. Procedures include: Overview of what a large docs site restructuring involves Add a new docs category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create dummy docs Overview of steps for a large docs site restructure project For some smaller docs site edits, you can sometimes simply edit the nav files and not have to touch the doc files or folders. But for larger projects, you may want to or need to edit and move the docs files and folders themselves. Below is a broad overview of the chunks of work such larger projects generally entail. Plan out what the new nav file structure will look like, and plan out the work of moving docs files or creating new folders. It can help to write down the chunks of work a large project will entail. Move the affected doc files to their new folder locations, making sure to add redirects. For more on that, see Move docs between folders. Delete any empty folders. For any folder or file edits you do to the file structure itself (including file or folder renaming, moving files and folders, but not including editing of content or front matter within a doc or nav file), do the same edits to the folders and files in the i18n directory. Not all folders or files will be present in the i18n directory: it only populates an mdx file or an associated folder if that mdx file has been marked for translation. Edit the nav files to reflect the new desired structure and point to the new doc URLs. For more specific and granular procedures, keep reading. Add a new category of docs We'll explain two procedures: adding a sub-category of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file: Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title. Add the docs you want in that section, emulating the format and indenting of other nav files. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. Adding new nav files should get sign-off from a docs site manager. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the standard nav file formatting and indenting. For more on structure, see nav format. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in a nav file. Do not place a doc in more than one nav file location: if you require a link to a doc from a different category, attempt to place that reference within a relevant doc section. To add a doc to a nav file: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the standard nav file formatting and indenting. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file Move a doc in the nav file when you want to change where it's visible in the sidebar menus. To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure the formatting and indenting match standard nav file structure. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move a doc between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming quite divergent, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create user confusion (for example, when the elements of the folder-based URL are very different than the nav-file-based location) or sub-optimal search engine results. Too much divergence can make it harder for us to find and edit docs, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL (for more on why, see Understand structure). Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file name and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about our scripts for programmatically adding redirects to an entire doc directory. Be sure that redirect URLs don't have a trailing slash. Move the doc to its new folder location. If that mdx file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if it's marked for translation), make an equivalent move of that file in the i18n directory. Update nav files with the new URL. Having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc's URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete or rename a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete or rename the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. Instructions for this: Because moving a folder or changing its name results in changing all the URLs of docs in that folder, you must first add redirects to the affected docs. You can do this manually (described in step #1 here) or you can use a script the docs team has for bulk-adding redirects to all the docs in a directory. Make the desired edit. For example, move the folder to the new location (dragging and dropping in the Finder window, for example), and/or rename the folder. If the edited folder is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if a doc in that folder has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that folder and its files in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: adding redirects for the mdx files being moved or deleted, then moving or deleting the docs, and then deleting the empty folders. Change a doc's file name Changing an mdx file's name results in its URL changing. Note that you can change a doc's displayed title in its front matter without changing the actual file name. Changing the file name can be useful. Instructions: Add a redirect to the doc whose file name you're changing. Change the file's name. If that file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if that doc has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that file's name in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. Create \"dummy\" docs We no longer want to have docs in multiple places in the nav files (although we still do have some docs that are like this). If you want a doc to be referenced in more than one location in the nav files, instead attempt to find a place within a doc where it makes sense to reference that doc.",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

Table template This is a basic table template. <table> <thead> <tr> <th style={{ width: \"200px\" }}> Item </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Item name </td> <td> Description of item </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Additional options: If you want to...

Highlight row in gray on hover Add the class table-hover to the <table> element. Specify individual column widths Set style=\"width:###px;\" in the header row. In general, for two-column tables on the docs site: Set the first column as 200 pixels: <th style=\"width:200px\">. To allow the table to adjust automatically to the remaining page width, do not set a width for the second column. Tables to describe UI functions When using tables to describe available functions, give readers a roadmap. They may know what they want to find or accomplish, but they may not know what it's called or how to do it. For example, to provide a list of features for a particular UI page, label the header's first column If you want to... and label the second column Do this.",

Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What New Relic products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! You can use metrics from your New Relic account to autoscale applications and services in your Kubernetes cluster by deploying the New Relic Metrics Adapter. This adapter fetches the metric values from New Relic and makes them available for the Horizontal Pod Autoscalers. The newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter implements the external.metrics.k8s.io API to support the use of external metrics based New Relic NRQL queries results. Once deployed, the value for each configured metric is fetched using the NerdGraph API based on the configured NRQL query. The metrics adapter exposes the metrics over a secured endpoint with TLS. New Relic metrics adapter in a cluster. Requirements Kubernetes 1.16 or higher. The New Relic Kubernetes integration. New Relic's user API key. No other External Metrics Adapter installed in the cluster. Installation To install the New Relic Metrics Adapter, we provide the newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter Helm chart, which is also included in the nri-bundle chart used to deploy all New Relic Kubernetes components. If not already installed, install our Kubernetes integration. Upgrade the installation to include the New Relic Metrics Adapter with the following command: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace --reuse-values \\ --set metrics-adapter.enabled=true \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_PERSONAL_API_KEY \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.accountID=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID \\ --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.external_metric_name.query=NRQL query Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: metrics-adapter.enabled: Must be set to true so the metrics adapter chart is installed. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.personalAPIKey: Must be set to valid New Relic Personal API key. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.accountID: Must be set to valid New Relic account where metrics are going to be fetched from. newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.config.externalMetrics.<var>external_metric_name</var>.<var>query</var>: Adds a new external metric where: <var>external_metric_name</var>: The metric name. <var>query</var>: The base NRQL query that is used to get the value for the metric. Tip Alternatively, you can use a values.yaml file that can be passed to the helm command with the --values flag. Values files can contain all parameters needed to configure the metrics explained in the configuration section. Configuration You can configure multiple metrics in the metrics adapter and change some parameters to modify the behaviour of the metrics cache and filtering. To see the full list and descriptions of all parameters that can be modified, refer to the chart README.md and values.yaml files. How it works The following example is a Helm values file that enable the metrics adapter on the nri-bundle chart installation, and configures the nginx_average_requests metric: metrics-adapter: enabled: true newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter: personalAPIKey: <Personal API Key> config: accountID: <Account ID> externalMetrics: nginx_average_requests: query: \"FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO\" Copy Caution The default time span for metrics is 1h. Therefore, you should define queries with the SINCE clause to adjust the time span according to your environment and needs. There is an HPA consuming the external metric as follows: kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2 metadata: name: nginx-scaler spec: scaleTargetRef: apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment name: nginx minReplicas: 1 maxReplicas: 10 metrics: - type: External external: metric: name: nginx_average_requests selector: matchLabels: k8s.namespaceName: nginx target: type: Value value: 10000 Copy Based on the HPA definition, the controller manager fetches the metrics from the external metrics API which are served by the New Relic metrics adapter. The New Relic metrics adapter receives the query including the nginx_average_requests metric name and all the selectors, and searches for a matching metric name in the internal memory based on the configured metrics. Then, it adds the selectors to the query to form a final query that is executed using NerdGraph to fetch the value from New Relic. The above example will generate a query like the following: FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) WHERE clusterName=<clusterName> AND `k8s.namespaceName`='nginx' SINCE 2 MINUTES AGO Copy Notice that a clusterName filter has been automatically added to the query to exclude metrics from other clusters in the same account. You can remove it by using the removeClusterFilter configuration parameter. Also the value is cached for a period of time defined by the cacheTTLSeconds configuration parameter, whose default is 30 seconds. Troubleshooting Get verbose logs Most common errors are displayed in the standard (non-verbose) logs. If you're doing a more in-depth investigation on your own or with New Relic Support, you can enable verbose mode. To get verbose logging details for an integration using Helm: Enable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade -n <namespace> --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=true newrelic/nri-bundle Leave on verbose mode for a few minutes, or until enough activity has occurred. When you have the information you need, disable verbose logging: bash Copy $ helm upgrade --reuse-values newrelic-bundle --set newrelic-k8s-metrics-adapter.verboseLog=false newrelic/nri-bundle Caution Verbose mode increases significantly the amount of information sent to log files. Enable this mode temporarily, only for troubleshooting purposes, and reset the log level when finished. Get raw metrics Sometimes it's useful to get the list of available metrics and also to get the current value of an specific metric. To get the list of metrics available, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/\" To get the value for a specific metric with a selector, run: bash Copy $ kubectl get --raw \"/apis/external.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/*/<metric_name>?labelSelector=<selector_key>=<selector_value>\" Tip You must replace <metric_name>, <selector_key> and <selector_value> with your values. Metrics not working There are some usual errors that could cause a metric fail to retrieve the value. These errors are showed in the status of the metrics when you describe the HPA or are printed when you get the raw metrics directly. executing query: NRQL Syntax Error: Error at line...: The query that is being run has syntax errors. The same error message gives you the executed query and position of the error. You can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter. extracting return value: expected first value to be of type \"float64\", got %!q(<nil>): The query doesn't return any value. The same error message gives you the executed query so you can try this query inside the New Relic query builder and correct the configuration from the adapter or the match selectors in the HPA.",

      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles is time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings, subheadings, and titles use sentence case. This means you should capitalize the first word of the title and proper nouns only. You should also capitalize the first word after a colon. Avoid dashes and ellipses in headlines and titles. Avoid using punctuation, with the exception of question marks. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

      "body": "The infrastructure agent is a lightweight piece of software, designed to minimize its impact on the performance of your hosts. However, the exact load varies depending on your host's workload, particularly on the number of processes running on the host. This is because the agent collects detailed data from each individual process. As a general guideline, New Relic has collected benchmarks for some common types of hosts: Linux single-task host The agent has very low performance overhead on a classic, single-task host. For example, a server running Apache, Unicorn, or a single Java application. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of classic, single-task host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.3% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux Docker host The agent has very low performance overhead on a host running Docker, with exact usage depending on the number of Docker containers your machine hosts, and whether those processes are long- or short-lived. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge: vCPUs: 8 vCPUs Memory: 32.0 GB Storage: 160.0 GB Number of containers: 25 containers, about 100 long-lived processes running in containers Operating system: CentOS 7 For this type of Docker host, typical usage is: CPU: about 0.8% Virtual memory: about 1 GB Resident memory: 25 to 35 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Windows host The agent has very low performance overhead on a typical Windows host serving web apps and running the Windows/IIS stack. Our benchmarks for this type of host are based on an Amazon EC2 t2.small: vCPUs: 1 Memory: 2.0 GB Storage: 30.0 GB Operating system: Windows Server 2012 R2 For this type of Windows host, typical usage is: CPU: 2 to 3% Resident Memory: 30 MB Storage on disk: about 50 MB Linux ARM64 host The agent has similar performance overhead on an ARM64 (Graviton 2) host on EC2 when compared with AMD64 machines. The benchmark is based on Amazon EC2 t3.2xlarge vs. t4g.2xlarge instances. Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance with infrastructure agent default settings: CPU: about 0.1% on ARM vs 0.13% AMD Virtual memory: about 0.75GB ARM vs 1 GB AMD Resident memory: 20MB ARM vs 22 MB AMD We are always improving the performance of the infrastructure agent. If you see unusually high agent performance overhead, get support at support.newrelic.com. Manage data To learn how to adjust how much data our infrastructure monitoring ingests and reports, see Manage infrastructure data. Resource utilization On Linux systems, infrastructure is installed with default settings for each supported service manager. A memory limit of 1 Gigabyte is enforced. Please consider reviewing and adjusting the default configuration based on your system requirements.",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

However, if your table becomes too long, follow the \"five to nine\" guideline and consider restructuring the information in other ways. Use sentence case for text in every table column unless it's a specific file name or code value that requires lower case or all caps. Table template This is a basic table template. <table> <thead> <tr> <th style={{ width: \"200px\" }}> Item </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Item name </td> <td> Description of item </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Additional options: If you want to... Do this Shade every other row Use <table class=\"alternate\">. Create a table within a clamshell Use <table class=\"spec\">. Highlight row in gray on hover Add the class table-hover to the <table> element. Specify individual column widths Set style=\"width:###px;\" in the header row. In general, for two-column tables on the docs site: Set the first column as 200 pixels: <th style=\"width:200px\">. To allow the table to adjust automatically to the remaining page width, do not set a width for the second column. Tables to describe UI functions When using tables to describe available functions, give readers a roadmap. They may know what they want to find or accomplish, but they may not know what it's called or how to do it. For example, to provide a list of features for a particular UI page, label the header's first column If you want to... and label the second column Do this.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

Read on for some guidelines on how to decide what to capitalize in a document's title, headings, products, features, and other elements of the page. Use sentence case in headings Use sentence case for headings. This includes category headings and document titles. With sentence case, capitalize only the first letter of: The first word Proper nouns Acronyms and abbreviations We have some exceptions: If the heading is a code term, such as a variable or function, then capitalize it exactly as it's used in the code; for example: noticeError. If the heading includes a colon, follow the Microsoft Style Guide for titles and headings, and capitalize the first word that appears after the colon; for example: APM Error profiles: Troubleshoot trends. Important Use sentence case for graphical illustrations such as diagrams and figures. Explore our Screenshots and images document for more information on our image guidelines. Products and features Item Example We use title case for products. Infinite Tracing We don't capitalize features (including features that used to be products). Use transaction traces to... not Use Transaction Traces to... Our infrastructure monitoring... not Our Infrastructure monitoring... UI elements and UI page paths Item Example We use sentence case and bold for UI elements, even if the UI element is in a different case in the UI. \"From the Transactions page, select Transaction traces and...\" We use sentence case and bold for each element in a path that references UI pages.

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the Instant Observability catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Instant Observability: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack using the Apps filter or search bar: Notice that there is no information on the Instant Observability or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. For these, you need to provide catalog information to your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create catalog directories to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your root catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application.

Consider some common solutions for resolving these issues. Publish your Nerdpack Remember that you can only submit catalog metadata for Nerdpacks that have already been published. If you try to submit information for a Nerdpack that hasn't been published, the CLI will try to help: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Uploading screenshots... › Error: 1 error while updating DemoApp 1.0.0 › › Invalid Version: Nerdpack version 1.0.0 not found.

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

However, if your table becomes too long, follow the \"five to nine\" guideline and consider restructuring the information in other ways.

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. With New Relic you can define and consume service level indicators and service level objectives for your applications. What are SLIs and SLOs? Service levels are used to measure the performance of a service from the end user (or client application) point of view. For instance, a Service Level can represent whether a video loaded quickly enough, or whether a directions service returned at least one possible route between two points. Service level indicators (SLIs) are accurate quantitative measures of the user experience as described by a service level. They represent a proportion of successful outputs, and therefore they’re expressed as a percentage (%). For example, an SLI can measure the proportion of requests that were faster than some threshold, or the proportion of records coming into a pipeline that resulted in the correct value coming out. And while users understand that a video might take a few additional seconds to load, or that an application might return an error from time to time, this shouldn’t happen often if you don’t want to lose their trust. Therefore, once you’ve defined SLIs for the performance aspects that are most relevant for the end users of your services, you need to set SLOs to track that the service is meeting their expectations. Service level objectives (SLOs) are defined as a target value that an SLI must meet over a period of time. For example, videos must start playing in less than 2 seconds 99% of the time over a week period. Please refer to the Service level management use case implementation guide to learn more about identifying service boundaries and deploying the instrumentation that your service levels will be based on. Service levels and APM SLA reports New Relic has provided automatic SLA Reports for APM Services for a long time. The Apdex-based reports, which you can get on your email inbox on Mondays, are automatically generated for services that produce web transactions, and are useful to see trends over time. On top of the SLAs, our new SLM level capability is better aligned with modern service level best practices, such as those promoted by the Google SRE Handbook, and provides new, improved functionality: SLIs can be defined on any NRDB event that is reported to New Relic, not just APM transactions. Therefore you can also base SLIs on your own custom events. You can decide which service boundaries and which metrics are relevant for your service levels, and you can set your own objectives. You can view SLO results across your accounts, and within your workloads. What's next? Ready to get started? If you don't already have one, sign up for a free New Relic account. You can find service levels in several places in New Relic One: At the top nav bar, under the More menu (which you can customize). At the previews of those entities that have an SLI defined. In APM services, at the reports section. Within a workload, at the service levels tab. Carry on and read our docs on how to create and consume SLIs and SLOs. You can also check out how to manage SLMs with our API.",

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "Tables help you organize information to make it easier for readers to skim. However, if your table becomes too long, follow the \"five to nine\" guideline and consider restructuring the information in other ways. Use sentence case for text in every table column unless it's a specific file name or code value that requires lower case or all caps. Table template This is a basic table template. <table> <thead> <tr> <th style={{ width: \"200px\" }}> Item </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Item name </td> <td> Description of item </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Additional options: If you want to...

In general, for two-column tables on the docs site: Set the first column as 200 pixels: <th style=\"width:200px\">. To allow the table to adjust automatically to the remaining page width, do not set a width for the second column. Tables to describe UI functions When using tables to describe available functions, give readers a roadmap.

      "body": "For consistency across New Relic content, here are our general word usage guidelines: We generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, which is based on the Chicago Manual of Style. We follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. We defer to the official product names for references to products. (For example, for Amazon Web Services (AWS), see aws.amazon.com/products.) For terminology specific to New Relic, we use the product glossary. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Avoid these Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Subbing for i.e. is tricker, because sometimes people use it to mean that is, while at other times it's mis-used to mean for example. Read the context to be clear, but usually the best solution is to rewrite so the description is clear without needing explanatory text. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. It should have a period at the end (etc.). Ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using it. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Avoid using generically, to avoid confusion with infrastructure monitoring. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS, Mac OS X, or OS X. master account We previously used master account and sub-account but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with New Relic. For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say we and our when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with New Relic mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use you and your liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "Lists are a powerful way to organize information, but they don't always make for a pleasant reading experience. Keep these points in mind when you're writing a list: Always capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item. Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step procedures, where the order matters. Use unordered (bulleted) lists to make it easier for users to skim related information. Use OR on a separate line when there is more than one option for a numbered step or a bullet point. Use tables when your ordered or unordered list would benefit from some extra detail. Tip For punctuation guidelines, follow the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, which includes considerations for localization. Here's an example of an ordered list as a table. Because each step is a row, the table helps to structure the levels of detail. In-line lists As an alternative to using bullet point lists, you can do an in-line list, like this: C SDK | Go | Java. You might want to use an in-line list when: You're linking to further documentation. Customers will likely be selecting a single option. The list item can be displayed with a short word or phrase (like Java, or Infrastructure). You think a bullet point list takes up a lot of vertical space. This may happen in circumstances where a procedure must include several lists. Here's one example of this. There are only two or three potential options they'll be choosing from and a bullet point list seems unnecessary. Here's an example.",

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing model, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full platform ingested data. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full platform users This query shows the billable full platform users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full platform users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full platform user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full platform user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full platform users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full platform users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should use the Event Timer method, which works very well with infrequent data. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are three options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, and ProactiveDetection. (Starting November 1, 2021, IncidentIntelligence is no longer a billing factor). For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing model. If you’re on our original pricing model, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing model works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing model that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing model are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full platform users, who have access to our more curated UI experiences. Basic users are free. The cost of each full platform user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full platform user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing model, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Full platform user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full platform users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full platform users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full platform users for that month. A full platform user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full platform user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full platform user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full platform user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full platform user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full platform users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full platform user or converted to a full platform user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing model includes one free full platform user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full platform user in another account. In such cases, the full platform user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full platform user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full platform user, and unlimited basic users. To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts We have a number of callout types, and each is controlled by the variant you include in the <Callout> tag. Here's an example of the format for a tip callout: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy Here are examples of our callout variants: Caution Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use <Callout variant=\"caution\">. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use <Callout variant=\"important\">. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use <Callout variant=\"tip\">. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

Keep these points in mind when you're writing a list: Always capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item. Use ordered (numbered) lists for step-by-step procedures, where the order matters. Use unordered (bulleted) lists to make it easier for users to skim related information. Use OR on a separate line when there is more than one option for a numbered step or a bullet point. Use tables when your ordered or unordered list would benefit from some extra detail. Tip For punctuation guidelines, follow the Microsoft Writing Style Guide, which includes considerations for localization. Here's an example of an ordered list as a table. Because each step is a row, the table helps to structure the levels of detail. In-line lists As an alternative to using bullet point lists, you can do an in-line list, like this: C SDK | Go | Java. You might want to use an in-line list when: You're linking to further documentation. Customers will likely be selecting a single option. The list item can be displayed with a short word or phrase (like Java, or Infrastructure). You think a bullet point list takes up a lot of vertical space.

      "body": "New Relic lets you set up automated user management (AUM), which allows you to import, update, and deactivate your New Relic users from an identity provider, like Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin. Benefits Before reading the benefits of automated user management, we recommend reading Get started with SAML SSO and SCIM. Benefits of enabling automated user management include: Time and cost efficiency: When you make changes in your identity provider, such as creating, updating, and removing users, these changes are automatically reflected in New Relic. By being able to manage a large set of users from your identity provider, it reduces the workload of your admins who'd otherwise need to do a significant amount of work in New Relic to accomplish the same thing. Increased productivity: By having a more automatic way to set up users and groups, they're enabled and ready to use New Relic more quickly. Enhanced security: SCIM is an industry standard protocol for maintaining groups of users. Use of this feature requires SAML SSO, so once your users are added to New Relic, they can log in using your identity provider. Popular identity providers Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin have dedicated New Relic apps, improving ease of enablement. Requirements and recommendations Requirements and recommendations: Requires Pro or Enterprise edition. Supports SAML 2.0 standard for single sign on (SSO). Supports SCIM 2.0 standard. User model-related requirements: This feature requires you to be on our New Relic One user model and creates users on that model. If you're on our original user model (or otherwise can't seem to implement this feature), talk to your New Relic account representative. Configuration requires that a user have the Authentication domain manager and the Organization manager role (users in the default group Admin have these). There are three identity providers that have a New Relic app: Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin. For other identity providers, you can use our SCIM API. Before enabling this, it helps to first set up user groups in your identity provider service and think about which New Relic roles and accounts those groups will have access to. Set up automated user management For an explanation of how your identity provider groups map over to New Relic groups, see Group and role mapping. To use automated user management to import users from your identity provider: It's important to first review the requirements. In the authentication domain UI, create a new authentication domain. If you use Azure AD, Okta, or OneLogin, use the applicable guide: Azure AD | Okta | OneLogin. If you don't use one of the above services, you'll need to: Use the authentication domain UI to enable SCIM as the source of users. Use our SCIM API to integrate with your identity provider service. See the SCIM API tutorial for all the steps involved. Highly recommended: Set a time zone for your users in your identity provider. How you do this will vary by identity provider. If not set in your identity provider, our UI shows UTC time zone dates/times. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). If you have issues, contact your account representative. After being provisioned, your users can click on the New Relic SCIM/SSO application tile in their identity provider to be logged into New Relic.

      "body": "Starting April 12, 2021, we're allowing some customers who have users on our original user model to self-serve and migrate those users to be on the New Relic One user model. Background On July 30, 2020, we released a new and improved user model called the New Relic One user model. This newer model offers a simpler, more efficient way to manage users and their access to roles and accounts. At first, this new model was available mainly to new customers, while users in pre-existing New Relic organizations remained on our original user model. But now some original-user-model organizations that meet some requirements can use a migration wizard to migrate their users to the new model. When that migration process is complete, your users are on the New Relic One user model and you’ll have new procedures for managing your users and their access to accounts. Benefits When you migrate your users to this model, benefits include: Viewing and managing all users from multiple accounts in one place. Fewer steps to add and manage users. Flexible authentication options. More granular roles for user management. For Enterprise customers: access to automated user management via identity providers. Learn more about the benefits of the new model. Requirements Requirements include: You must be on the original user model. If you aren't sure which you are, see Determine user model. To use the user migration wizard, you must have the Owner role. Recommendations and considerations We have some recommendations below that apply to organizations who choose to do the user migration on their own. Note that these considerations won't apply if you're being helped by a New Relic representative; in that case, your account representative will give you guidance. We recommend not using the user migration wizard in these circumstances: If your organization has more than 20 accounts (unless you're getting help from a New Relic representative). Note that this refers to having 20 or more accounts, not users. If you frequently add accounts. Currently, users on the new user model require New Relic assistance to add accounts. If you think any of the new user model impacts and limitations might affect you negatively. If you require account-level roles for user management capabilities. Roles related to user management (ability to add and update users, change user type, create access grants) currently apply across an organization and can't be assigned at an account level. If you have questions about whether you should use the user migration wizard, talk to your New Relic account representative. Understand user management concepts During the user migration procedure, you'll have a choice to either grant all your users access to all your organization's accounts, or to assign more granular access (set the roles and accounts your user groups have access to). The more you need to partition access to accounts or roles, the more it will help you to understand some basics about the newer user management concepts. Here's a brief summary: Users are grouped in a container called an \"authentication domain\". The domain governs how users are added to New Relic (manually with the UI or automatically via SCIM). It also governs how users log in (manually with email/password or using SAML SSO). Most organizations will have just one or two authentication domains: one for the default manual settings and another for the more automatic methods. Users can be assigned to one or more groups (for example, our default Admin group or a custom group like Contractors). For large organizations, users are often assigned to multiple groups. When you want to give a user group access to a specific role and a specific account, you must create an access grant. For example, you may give a Contractors group access to our default All product admin role on one or more of your accounts, or give that group a custom role. To learn more, see User management concepts. Optional: plan out user groups and access grants If you'll need to do a good amount of partitioning of users' access to accounts or roles, you'll want to think about how you'll implement groups for your organization. Here are some tips for how different types of organizations may use groups: For organizations with a good number of accounts, a common configuration is to have one user group with the Organization manager role (organization-level management capabilities), one group with the Authentication domain manager (user management capabilities), a group with the Billing user (billing-related capabilities) on the primary (first) account, and then configuring various users groups for admins, users, and other roles as needed on your other accounts. Customers with smaller and/oor flatter organizations that are okay with transparency for all teams across all of their data could have as little as one or two groups. For organizations where all data is in a single account, a common configuration might be having five or six groups. Migrate your users with the migration wizard Before you start, be sure you've read the requirements. To start using the wizard: From one.newrelic.com, click Apps in the top navigation. In the table of apps, click the User migration walkthrough app. Optional: If you want more help and context, see the sections below for tips and recommendations for specific migration wizard pages. If you've successfully completed migration, learn how to manage your users. Step 1: Create admins Tips: You can either a) import all current admins for your account or b) specify the admins that should have access to user management capabilities. Note that you can add more admin users and edit permissions after you complete the migration process. If you've already used the wizard to set up an admin on the new user model, have the admin sign in using their new user record to access the migration tool. The user migration wizard, when completed, destroys the old user record, but if you've started the user migration process without completing it, you may have users with access to both the original and new record, as shown below: If a user on the new model has been created and the migration process hasn't been completed, they may have access to both the original user record and the new user records. If you plan on migrating only a portion of your users to the new user model to start, we recommend leaving some original user model admins so that you have an admin to manage your users on the original model. Step 2: Set up organization You may choose a) a guided setup that allows more configuration options, or b) an automatic setup with fewer steps. Some notes on the automatic setup: It won't transition SSO or SCIM configurations. Instead, users will be provisioned manually and will log in manually with their username and password. It provides all users with access to all accounts. If you use SSO or SCIM provisioning today or require some accounts to be inaccessible by certain user groups, don't use the automatic option. Step 3: Name your organization Name your organization something descriptive and easily recognizable. Step 4: Authentication domain settings This section controls how users are provisioned (added to New Relic) and how they authenticate (log in). Note that choosing SAML SSO or SCIM setup will require you to exit the migration wizard and configure things elsewhere in the New Relic UI. Here's more detail about the two authentication domain sections: Managing users For how users are added and managed, you can select Manually or Identity provider. The option to use your identity provider to provision users is available only if your organization has Enterprise edition. If you choose Identity provider, you must follow additional steps for using specific identity providers. Once you do that, these users are created on the new user model and synced in New Relic based on your identity provider configuration. Note that if you're already using an app made by Okta, Azure, or OneLogin, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps. After you complete provisioning users, you can confirm that these users have been added by seeing if they’re in the new User management UI. If you’ve selected the guided workflow, we’ll match these users by email address. There will be no need to later complete the user import step for these users given they’ll have been brought into New Relic via your identity provider. When done, you can skip ahead to the Migrate assets step. Login methods If you chose Manually for managing users, you have a choice for how those users log in. You can select either a) email/password login or b) single sign on (SSO). Note that SSO is available only for organizations with Pro or Enterprise edition. You can select multiple authentication methods based on your needs. For example, you might use SSO for your employees and username/password for contractors. If you select SSO, you must complete additional configuration steps. You can complete the procedure for setting up SSO, and then come back to the migration wizard to continue the migration process. If you select more than one authentication method, note that you’ll need to add a new authentication domain. Note that if you're already using an identity provider's New Relic app, you'll probably need to use a newer version made for New Relic's newer user model. For more on this, see Identity provider apps, below. A note about identity provider apps Okta, Azure, and OneLogin have New Relic apps for both the original user model and the New Relic One user model. The original apps are titled \"New Relic by account\" while the newer apps are titled \"New Relic by organization.\" If you're already using one of the New Relic apps, it's likely made for the original user model, which means you'll need to set up a new app. Step 5: Import existing users Recommended: Download the full list of existing original user model users before choosing to import users. This will be a useful resource and serve as a backup, if you need it. After downloading your original user model users, you can upload all users or just some of them. This step will create user records on the New Relic One user model. In a later step, you’ll be able to transition these users' assets. The new user record that's created has the same login credentials: there is no need to reset passwords. If a user has a pending email verification status (pending being verified), that will also be transitioned over. Important tips: Ensure the new users' email addresses match their original user record email addresses, including matching exact case. We use email addresses as the key value to match users and, in a later step, to transition their user-associated assets. Once you complete this step and create new user records, we highly recommend completing the migration process without delay. If you don't complete the steps to migrate assets and delete the original user record, a user may see two user records when logging in (see login screenshot from Step 1) or else may be missing assets they expect to see (like dashboards). Step 6: Access settings This step allows you to determine the level of access your users have. If you need to map user access to specific accounts and roles, then you'll want to set up groups and access grants at this stage. You'll need to create an access grant for each account that you want a group to have access to. For example, a DevOps group might have five different access grants, each giving the group access to a different account. This procedure is done separately from the user migration wizard procedure. For more on how to create access grants, see the user management tutorial. Step 7: Migrate user assets Upon completion of this step, personal assets are migrated to new user records and the original user record is deleted. User assets include: Dashboards Favorites Weekly email settings Email opt in/out preferences User-specific user keys New Relic One apps NerdStorage data If a user has access to several organizations that use New Relic (for example, if that user is a contractor), their original user model record won't be fully deleted until all those organizations migrate their users. It's possible that such a user will have both an original user record and one or more new user records and this will be displayed upon login (see login screenshot in Page 1 section). Step 8: Review and finish If you're migrating users in chunks and not all at once, you can go through the migration workflow several times with different groups of users. You can only click Finish Setup when all users in the organization are migrated. After you're done Once your users are migrated to the new user model, you can find and manage them by clicking the account dropdown, clicking Administration, and using these UI pages: User management: use this to view and add users, change their type (basic versus full), change their group, and approve user upgrade requests. Organization and access: use this to create access grants (granting groups access to roles and accounts), and configure authentication domains (SAML SSO settings and SCIM settings, and more). For more about these tools, see the new user management docs.",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

Export your telemetry data to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Protocol, or OTLP for short, is a general purpose telemetry data delivery protocol designed for the OpenTelemetry project. This protocol describes how to encode and transmit telemetry data, which makes it a natural choice for data transport. Each language SDK provides an OTLP exporter you can configure to export data over OTLP. In this step, we focus on how to configure an OTLP exporter in your service to export data directly to New Relic. If you prefer to export your data first to an OpenTelemetry collector, we have separate instructions. Here's an example of sending data from your service directly to New Relic. To complete this third step, first familiarize yourself with some required New Relic settings, and then complete the steps in the OTLP exporter documentation for your language. Review New Relic settings for exports Before you go to the external OTLP exporter documentation, consult the table below so you're ready to do the following: Configure the OTLP exporter to add a header (api-key) whose value is the license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. Based on your region, configure the endpoint where the exporter sends data to New Relic. Region gRPC HTTP/1.1 Endpoint API header name API header value TLS encryption required US ✅ ❌ https://otlp.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ EU ✅ ❌ https://otlp.eu01.nr-data.net:4317 api-key License key ✅ Important If you have FedRamp compliance constraints, you will need to use https://gov-otlp.nr-data.net:4317. Please see FedRAMP-compliant endpoints for further information. Important In Node.js, the opentelemetry-collector-grpc library requires additional options to enable TLS. Complete the export configuration steps Click on the link below for your language and complete the configuration steps. When you're done, return here to complete Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI. C++ Erlang Go Java Javascript/Node.js .NET PHP Python Ruby Rust Swift ...Find additional OTLP language support in GitHub Export data to an OpenTelemetry Collector (optional) The OpenTelemetry Collector is a configurable and extensible software component to receive, process, and export telemetry data. When you set up a collector, it can operate as a gateway or as an agent: Gateway: The collector receives data from a variety of sources and applies standard processing before exporting to some backend. Agent: The collector is deployed on each host in an environment and can collect telemetry data about the host and processes running on it. When you use a collector, you start by following the same routine as above for setting up OTLP in your service. In this case, instead of exporting data directly to New Relic, you export through a collector that you set up. In the collector, you configure the OTLP exporter to export data to New Relic. When your data goes through a collector, the transport looks like this: Here's a Docker example of how to set up and run an OpenTelemetry collector with the collector YAML: Save the following as otel-config.yaml: receivers: otlp: protocols: grpc: http: processors: batch: exporters: otlp: endpoint: ${OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT} headers: api-key: ${NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY} service: pipelines: traces: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] metrics: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] logs: receivers: [otlp] processors: [batch] exporters: [otlp] Copy Run the OpenTelemetry collector after you make the following changes: Replace OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE with the appropriate endpoint, using the <hostname>:<port> format without http(s):// (for example, otlp.nr-data.net:4317). Replace YOUR_KEY_HERE with your account's license key. export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=OTLP_ENDPOINT_HERE export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE docker run --rm \\ -e OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT \\ -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ -p 4317:4317 \\ -v \"${PWD}/otel-config.yaml\":/otel-config.yaml \\ --name otelcol \\ otel/opentelemetry-collector \\ --config otel-config.yaml Copy Step 4. View your data in the New Relic UI Once you’ve instrumented your service and configured it to export its data to New Relic, watch the New Relic One user interface for your traces, metrics, and logs! The UI for OpenTelemetry has some similarities to the APM agent UI, so if you are familiar with that, you can go right to the UI. If you need help understanding your OpenTelemetry UI options or how to make sure your data appears in the UI, see View your OpenTelemetry data in New Relic.

      "body": "You'll be able to configure our .NET agent to suit your environnment after you create a New Relic account (it's free, forever) and install the .NET agent. Configuration overview APM agent configuration options allow you to control some aspects of how the agent behaves. Some of these config options are part of the basic install process (like setting your license key and app name), but most are more advanced settings, such as setting a log level, setting up proxy host access, excluding certain attributes, and enabling distributed tracing. The .NET agent gets its configuration from the newrelic.config file, which is generated as part of the install process. By default, only a global newrelic.config file is created, but you can also create app-local newrelic.config files for finer control over a multi-app system. Other ways to set config options include: using environment variables, or setting server-side configuration from the UI. For more on the various config options and what overrides what, see Config settings precedence. Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core use the same configuration options and have the same APM features, unless otherwise stated. If you make changes to the config file and want to validate that it's in the right format, you can check it against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows) with any XSD validator. Important For IIS: after you change your newrelic.config or app.config file, perform an IISRESET from an administrative command prompt. Log level adjustments do not require a reset. Configuration methods and precedence levels Upon installation, the .NET agent's configuration file (newrelic.config) applies to all monitored applications, but you can configure the agent in other ways. Here's a diagram showing how different configuration options take precedence over one another: This diagram explains the order of precedence for different ways you might configure the .NET agent. Here are details about the configuration methods shown in the diagram, and their precedence levels: .NET configuration Details and precedence web.config or app.config or appsettings.json Configuration settings set in these files take highest precedence. However, if the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Environment variables Second-highest precedence. For more about these, see .NET environment variables. Server-side configuration Third-highest precedence. A limited number of server-side configuration settings are available; the other settings will come from other configuration sources. App-local newrelic.config Fourth-highest precedence. You can create app-local newrelic.config files to configure individual apps on a multi-app system. These local configuration files override settings in the global newrelic.config file. The agent looks for app-local config files in the following directories, in this order: A directory specified in your web.config or app.config file with the NewRelic.ConfigFile property The web app's root directory (with the app.config or web.config) The directory containing your app's executable file Note that the app-local config file must be complete and validate against the XSD file (for example, at C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\newrelic.xsd for Windows). Default (global) newrelic.config Default source and the lowest precedence. Will configure all applications on a host in the absence of other config files. The global config file is located in the New Relic agent home directory: %PROGRAMDATA%\\New Relic\\.NET Agent Required environment variables New Relic's .NET agent relies on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to attach New Relic to your processes. Some .NET agent install procedures (like the MSI installer) will automatically set these variables for you; some procedures will require you to manually set them. Caution Security recommendation: You should consider what users can set system environment variables. You should also secure the accounts under which your applications execute to prevent user environment variables overriding system environment variables .NET Framework environment variables For .NET Framework, the following variables are required: COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. .NET Core environment variables For .NET Core, the following variables are required: Linux: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path/to/agent/directory CORECLR_PROFILER_PATH=\"${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/libNewRelicProfiler.so\" Copy Windows: CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A} NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=path\\to\\agent\\directory CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=path\\to\\agent\\directory Copy The .NET agent installer will add these to IIS or as system-wide environment variables. If your system has previously used monitoring services (non-New Relic), you may have a \"profiler conflict\" when trying to install and use the New Relic agent. More details: Profiler conflict explanation New Relic’s .NET agents rely on environment variables to tell the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) to load New Relic into your processes. The install-related environment variables are Microsoft variables, not New Relic variables. They can be used by other .NET profilers, and only one profiler can be attached to a process at a time. For this reason, if you have used previous application monitoring products, you may have profiler conflicts. For specific install instructions, see the .NET agent install documentation. Optional environment variables Some configuration options in New Relic's .NET agent can be set via environment variables as an alternative to setting them in a config file. Below is a list of environment variables recognized by the .NET agent with example values. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED=2000 NEW_RELIC_LABELS=foo:bar;zip:zap NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY=XXXXXXXX NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true NEWRELIC_PROFILER_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\a\\directory (not configurable via config file) NEWRELIC_LOG_DIRECTORY=path\\to\\a\\directory (Insert a directory where you want to put the agent and profiler logs. You can't set this directory for both agent and profiler logs in the configuration file.) NEWRELIC_LOG_LEVEL=off|error|warn|info|debug|finest|all Copy If you're using New Relic APM and CodeStream, see how to associate repositories and how to associate build SHAs or release tags with errors inbox. Setup options, newrelic.config Use these options to setup and configure your agent via the newrelic.config file. The New Relic .NET agent supports the following categories of setup options: Configuration element Service element Obscuring key element Proxy element Log element Application element (configuration) Data transmission element Host name Configuration element The root element of the configuration document is a configuration element. <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\" agentEnabled=\"true\" maxStackTraceLines=\"50\" timingPrecision=\"low\"> Copy The configuration element supports the following attributes: agentEnabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the New Relic agent. maxStackTraceLines Type Integer Default 80 The maximum number of stack frames to trace in any stack dump. timingPrecision Type String Default low Controls the precision of the timers. High precision will provide better data, but at a lower execution speed. Possible values are high and low. Service element The first child of the configuration element is a service element. The service element configures the agent's connection to the New Relic service. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" sendEnvironmentInfo=\"true\" syncStartup=\"false\" sendDataOnExit=\"false\" sendDataOnExitThreshold=\"60000\" autoStart=\"true\"/> Copy The service element supports the following attributes: licenseKey (required) Type String Default (none) Your New Relic license key. New Relic uses the license key to match your app's data to the correct account in the UI. Set the license key via environment variable. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXXXX Copy sendEnvironmentInfo Type Boolean Default true Instructs the agent to record execution environment information. Environment information includes operating system, agent version, and which assemblies are available. syncStartup Type Boolean Default false Block application startup until the agent connects to New Relic. If set to true, the first transaction may take substantially longer to complete, because it is blocked until the connection to New Relic is finished. sendDataOnExit Type Boolean Default false Block application shutdown while the agent initiates a final harvest cycle and sends all data to New Relic. sendDataOnExitThreshold Type Integer Default 60000 Unit Milliseconds The minimum amount of time the process must run before the agent blocks it from shutting down. This setting only applies when sendDataOnExit is true. completeTransactionsOnThread Type Boolean Default false If false, the agent uses a pool thread to complete the transaction processing. If true, the agent will complete transaction processing on the request thread. requestTimeout Type Integer Default 2000 (sendDataOnExit enabled) 120000 (sendDataOnExit disabled) Unit Milliseconds The agent's request timeout when communicating with New Relic. autoStart Type Boolean Default True Automatically start the .NET agent when the first instrumented method is hit. Obscuring key element The obscuringKey element is an optional child of the service element. The .NET Agent uses this value to deobfuscate supported configuration values. For example, when an obfuscated proxy password is supplied, it will be deobfuscated using this key. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <obscuringKey>OBSCURING_KEY</obscuringKey> </service> Copy The obscuring key may also be configured by setting the NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_OBSCURING_KEY environment variable. Caution Security recommendation: The placement of the obscuring Key in the same configuration file as an obfuscated value may pose a security risk. Consider placing the obscuring key in an environment variable and limiting access to environment variables within your environment. Proxy element The proxy element is an optional child of the service element. The proxy element is used when the agent communicates to the New Relic back-end service via a proxy. <service licenseKey=\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"> <proxy host=\"hostname\" port=\"PROXY_PORT\" uriPath=\"path/to/something.aspx\" domain=\"mydomain.com\" user=\"PROXY_USERNAME\" password=\"PROXY_PASSWORD\" passwordObfuscated=\"OBFUSCATED_PROXY_PASSWORD\"/> </service> Copy The proxy element supports the following attributes: host Type String Default (none) Defines the proxy host. port Type Integer Default 8080 Defines the proxy port. uriPath Type String Default (none) Optionally define a proxy URI path. domain Type String Default (none) Optionally define a domain to use when authenticating with the proxy server. user Type String Default (none) Optionally define a user name for authentication. password Type String Default (none) Optionally define a password for authentication. passwordObfuscated Type String Default (none) For additional security, the .NET Agent supports the use of an obfuscated proxy password with the passwordObfuscated attribute. The obfuscated proxy password is generated using the following New Relic CLI command: newrelic agent config obfuscate --key OBSCURING_KEY --value \"CLEAR_TEXT_PROXY_PASSWORD\" Copy Important When using an obfuscated proxy password, the obscuring key must also be configured. Log element The log element is a child of the configuration element. The log element configures New Relic's logging . The agent generates its own log file to keep its logging information separate from your application's logs. <log level=\"info\" auditLog=\"false\" console=\"false\" directory=\"PATH\\TO\\LOG\\DIRECTORY\" fileName=\"FILENAME.log\" /> Copy The log element supports the following attributes: level Type String Default info Defines the level of detail recorded in the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: off error warn info debug finest all Alternatively, set the NEWRELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variable in the application's environment. Important Increasing the log level will increase New Relic's performance impact. auditLog Type Boolean Default false Records all data sent to and received from New Relic in both an auditlog log file and the standard log file. console Type Boolean Default false Send log messages to the console, in addition to the log file. directory Type String Default C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\Logs The directory to hold log files generated by the agent. If this is omitted, then a directory named logs in the New Relic agent install area will be used by default. fileName Type String Default (none) Defines a name for the log file. If you do not define a fileName, the name is derived from the name of the monitored process. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_LOG environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_LOG=MyApp.log Copy Application element (required) The application element is a child of the configuration element. This required element defines your application name, and disables or enables sampling. name Type String Default My Application The name of your .NET application is a child of the application element. New Relic will aggregate your data according to this name. For example, if you have two running applications named AppA and AppB, you will see two applications in the New Relic interface: AppA and AppB. You can also assign up to three names to your app. The first name is the primary name. For example: <application> <name>MY APPLICATION PRIMARY</name> <name>SECOND APP NAME</name> <name>THIRD APP NAME</name> </application> Copy Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=Descriptive Name Copy disableSamplers Type Boolean Default false Samplers collect information about memory and CPU consumption. Set this to true to disable sampling. Alternatively, set the NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISABLE_SAMPLERS=true Copy Data transmission element The dataTransmission element is a child of the configuration element. This element affects how data is sent to New Relic and can be used if you have specific data transmission requirements. <dataTransmission putForDataSend=\"false\" compressedContentEncoding=\"deflate\"/> Copy The dataTransmission element supports the following attributes: putForDataSend Type Boolean Default false Defines the HTTP method used when sending data to New Relic. Set this to true to enable using the PUT method when sending data. The POST method is used by default. Host name If the default host name label in the APM UI is not useful, you can decorate that name in the New Relic UI with a display name. After the application process is restarted and the .NET agent is reporting again, the display name will appear in the Servers drop-down list. This host name setting does not affect the list of hosts on your application's Summary page. To set a display name, choose one of the following options. The environment variable takes precedence over the config file value. Then restart your application to see your changes in the New Relic UI. Set using config file Set the displayName attribute in the processHost element in newrelic.config. The processHost element is a child of the configuration element. <configuration . . . > <processHost displayName=\"CUSTOM_NAME\" /> </configuration> Copy Set using environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME environment variable: NEW_RELIC_PROCESS_HOST_DISPLAY_NAME = \"CUSTOM_NAME\" Copy Cloud platform utilization Configures the utilization configuration element to control how the agent collects utilization information and sends it to the New Relic service to determine pricing. The agent can collect information from Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instances, Docker containers, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and Kubernetes. detectAws Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls AWS metadata API. detectAzure Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Azure metadata API. detectGcp Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls GCP metadata API. detectPcf Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls PCF information from environment variables. detectDocker Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent reads Docker information from the file system. detectKubernetes Type Boolean Default true Determines whether the agent polls Kubernetes information from environment variables. Instrumentation options Use these options to configure which elements of your application and environment to instrument. New Relic for .NET supports the following categories of instrumentation options: Instrumentation element Applications element (instrumentation) Attributes element Instrumentation element The instrumentation element is a child of the configuration element. By default, the .NET agent instruments IIS asp worker processes and Azure web and worker roles. To instrument other processes, see Instrumenting custom applications. Applications element (instrumentation) The applications element is a child of the instrumentation element. The applications element specifies which non-web apps to instrument. It contains a name attribute. Important This is not the same as the application (configuration) element, which is a child of the configuration element. <instrumentation> <applications> <application name=\"MyService1.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService2.exe\" /> <application name=\"MyService3.exe\" /> </applications> </instrumentation> Copy Attributes element An attribute is a key/value pair that determines the properties of an event or transaction. Each attribute is sent to APM transaction traces, APM error traces, Transaction events, TransactionError events, or PageView events. The primary attributes element enables or disables attribute collection for the .NET agent, and defines specific attributes to collect or exclude. You can also configure attribute settings based on their destination: Error collection, transaction traces, browser instrumentation, and transaction events. In this example, the agent excludes all attributes whose key begins with myApiKey (myApiKey.bar, myApiKey.value), but collects the custom attribute myApiKey.foo. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> Copy You can view the .NET APM attributes on the .NET agent attributes page. You can also define custom attributes with the agent API call AddCustomAttribute. enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable attribute collection. When set to false in the primary attribute element, this setting overrides all attribute settings for individual destinations. include Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will collect all attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. exclude Type String Default (none) If attributes are enabled, the agent will not collect attribute keys specified in this list. To specify multiple attribute keys, specify each individually. You can also use a * wildcard character at the end of a key to match multiple attributes (for example, myApiKey.*). For more information, see Attribute rules. Feature options Use these options to enable, disable, and configure New Relic features. New Relic for .NET allows you to configure the following features: App pools Cross application traces Error collection High security mode Strip exception messages Transaction events Custom events Custom parameters Tags/labels Browser instrumentation Slow Queries Transaction traces Datastore tracer Distributed tracing Span events Capture HTTP Request Headers App pools Important This is only applicable to a system's global config file. The applicationPools element is a child of the configuration element. The applicationPools element specifies for the profiler exactly which application pools to instrument and uses the same name as the IIS application pool name. This configuration element is useful when you may need to instrument only a small subset of your app pools. For example, a given server might have several hundred application pools, but only a few of those pools need to be instrumented by the .NET agent. Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"false\"/> </applicationPools> Copy Here is an example of disabling instrumentation for all application pools currently executing on the server and enabling instrumentation for specific application pools: <applicationPools> <defaultBehavior instrument=\"false\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Foo\" instrument=\"true\"/> <applicationPool name=\"Bar\" instrument=\"true\"/> </applicationPools> Copy The applicationPools element supports the following elements: defaultBehavior Type Boolean Default false Defines how the .NET agent will behave on a \"global\" level for application pools served via IIS. The .NET agent instruments all application pools by default. When true, application pools listed under applicationPool with an instrument attribute set to false will not be instrumented. Essentially, when set to false, the application pool list acts as an allow list. When set to true, the application pool list acts as a deny list. applicationPool Defines instrumentation behavior for a specific application pool. The name attribute is the name of an application pool. Enable or disable profiling in the instrument attribute. Define this application in the name attribute. Cross application traces The crossApplicationTracer element is a child of the configuration element. crossApplicationTracer links transaction traces across applications. When linked in a service-oriented architecture, all instrumented applications that communicate with each other via HTTP will now \"link\" transaction traces with the applications that they call and the applications they are called by. Cross application tracing makes it easier to understand the performance relationship between services and applications. <crossApplicationTracer enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The crossApplicationTracer element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable cross application tracing Error collection The errorCollector element is a child of the configuration element. errorCollector configures error collection, which captures information about uncaught exceptions and sends them to New Relic. <errorCollector enabled=\"true\" captureEvents=\"true\" maxEventSamplesStored=\"100\"> <ignoreClasses> <errorClass>System.IO.FileNotFoundException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.Threading.ThreadAbortException</errorClass> </ignoreClasses> <ignoreMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Ignore message</message> <message>Ignore too</message> </errorClass> </ignoreMessages> <ignoreStatusCodes> <code>401</code> <code>404</code> </ignoreStatusCodes> <expectedClasses> <errorClass>System.ArgumentNullException</errorClass> <errorClass>System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException</errorClass> </expectedClasses> <expectedMessages> <errorClass name=\"System.Exception\"> <message>Expected message</message> <message>Expected too</message> </errorClass> </expectedMessages> <expectedStatusCodes>403,500-505</expectedStatusCodes> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </errorCollector> Copy Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. Important expectedClasses, expectedMessages, and expectedStatusCodes configuration settings require .NET agent version 8.31.0.0 or higher. The errorCollector element supports the following elements and attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the error collector. captureEvents Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capturing of error events. maxEventSamplesStored Type Integer Default 100 Reservoir limit for error events. ignoreClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be ignored. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used ignoreErrors (obsolete) Type String Default (none) Lists specific exceptions to not report to New Relic. The full name of the exception should be used, such as System.IO.FileNotFoundException. ignoreStatusCodes Type String Default (none) Lists specific HTTP error codes to not report to New Relic. You can use standard integral HTTP error codes, such as just 401, or you may use Microsoft full status codes with decimal points, such as 401.4 or 403.18. The status codes should be equal to or greater than 400. expectedClasses A list of fully qualified class names to be marked as expected. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedMessages An optional map of fully qualified class names to list of strings matching a substring of the message of an error. The maximum number of error class and message combinations that SHOULD be reported is 50. If more than 50 are listed, then only the first 50 SHOULD be used expectedStatusCodes A comma separated list of status codes. The list may include integer ranges, using a single dash (-) and will be inclusive of both the starting and ending integer in the range. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for error traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. High security mode The highSecurity element is a child of the configuration element. To enable high security mode, set this property to true and enable the high security property in the New Relic user interface. Enabling high security turns SSL on; request parameters, custom parameters and HTTP request headers are not collected; strip exception messages is enabled; and queries can't be sent to New Relic in their raw form. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable high security mode. Example: <highSecurity enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Strip exception messages The stripExceptionMessages element is a child of the configuration element. To enable strip exception messages, set this property to true. By default, this is set to false, which means that the agent sends messages from all exceptions to the New Relic collector. If you enable high security mode, this is automatically changed to true, and the agent strips the messages from exceptions. enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable strip exception messages. Example: <stripExceptionMessages enabled=\"true\"/> Copy Transaction events The transactionEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use transactionEvents to configure transaction events. <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy The transactionEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_TRANSACTION_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to transaction events. Attribute settings can be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Caution When distributed tracing and/or Infinite Tracing are enabled, information from transaction events is applied to the root Span Event of the transaction. Consider applying any attribute settings for transaction events to span events and/or apply them as Global Attribute settings. Custom events The customEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use customEvents to configure custom events. <customEvents enabled=\"true\" maximumSamplesStored=\"10000\"/> Copy The CustomEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Integer Default 10000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at once. Alternatively, set the MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable in the application's environment. MAX_EVENT_SAMPLES_STORED=500 Copy Custom parameters The customParameters element is a child of the configuration element. Use customParameters to configure custom parameters. <customParameters enabled=\"true\" /> Copy The CustomParameters element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the capture of custom parameters. Labels (tags) The labels element is a child of the configuration element. This sets tag names and values. The list is a semicolon delimited list of colon-separated name and value pairs. You can also use with the NEW_RELIC_LABELS environment variable. Example: <labels>foo:bar;zip:zap</labels> Copy Browser instrumentation The browserMonitoring element is a child of the configuration element. browserMonitoring configures browser monitoring in your .NET application. Browser gives you insight your end users' performance experience. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for your users' browsers to download and render your webpages by injecting a small amount of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page. // If you use both the Exclude and Attribute elements // the Exclude element must be listed first. <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy The browserMonitoring element supports the following attributes: autoInstrument Type Boolean Default true By default the agent automatically injects the browser agent JavaScript. To turn off automatic injection, set this attribute to false. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for browser monitoring. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. requestPathsExcluded Use this sub-element to prevent the browser agent from being injected in specific pages. The element is used as follows: <requestPathsExcluded> <path regex=\"url-regex-1\"/> <path regex=\"url-regex-2\"/> ... <path regex=\"url-regex-n\"/> </requestPathsExcluded> Copy The agent will not inject the browser agent into pages whose URL matches one of the specified regular expressions. The regular expression should follow Microsoft guidelines for the Regex class. It is a reference to the virtual directory of the path in your application and not the full URL of the path you wish to exclude. For example, to exclude the pages in https://www.mywebsite.com/mywebpages/ you would simply insert /mywebpages/ as the path regex value. The requestPathsExcluded element should be used in cases where it is impossible or undesirable to use the DisableBrowserMonitoring() call. To minimize a possible performance impact try to use as few regular expressions as possible and keep them as simple as possible. Slow queries The slowSql element is a child of the configuration element. slowSql configures capturing information about slow query executions, and captures and obfuscates explain plans for these queries. <slowSql enabled=\"true\"/> Copy The slowSql element supports the following attribute: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable slow query tracing. Transaction traces The transactionTracer element is a child of the configuration element. transactionTracer configures transaction traces. Included in the trace is the exact call sequence of the transactions, including any query statements issued. <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\" transactionThreshold=\"apdex_f\" recordSql=\"obfuscated\" explainEnabled=\"true\" explainThreshold=\"500\" maxSegments=\"3000\" maxExplainPlans=\"20\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy The transactionTracer element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable transaction traces. transactionThreshold Type String Default apdex_f Defines the threshold for transaction traces. If a transaction takes longer than the threshold, it is eligible for being traced. See transaction trace basics for more about the rules governing traces. The default value is apdex_f, which sets the threshold to four times the application's apdex_t value. For more information about apdex_t, see Apdex. You can also set the threshold to be a specific time value in milliseconds. recordSql Type String Default obfuscated Select a query tracing policy. Options are off, which records nothing; obfuscated, which records an obfuscated version of the query; or raw, which records the query exactly as it is issued to the database. Caution Recording raw queries may capture sensitive information. explainEnabled Type Boolean Default false When true, the agent captures EXPLAIN statements for slow queries. explainThreshold Type Integer Default 500 Unit Milliseconds The agent collects slow query data for queries that exceed this threshold, along with any available explain plans, as part of transaction traces. maxSegments Type Integer Default 3000 The maximum number of segments to collect in a transaction trace. maxExplainPlans Type Integer Default 20 The maximum number of explain plans to collect during a harvest cycle. maxStackTrace Type Integer Default 0 By default maxStackTrace is set to 0, which disables stack traces as part of a transaction trace. If this value is set greater than 0, then stack traces will be captured for transaction traces. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for transaction traces. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Datastore tracer The datastoreTracer element is a child of the configuration element. <datastoreTracer> <instanceReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <databaseNameReporting enabled=\"true\" /> <queryParameters enabled=\"false\" /> </datastoreTracer> Copy The datastoreTracer element supports the following sub-elements: instanceReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of datastore instance metrics (such as the host and port) for some database drivers. These are reported on slow query traces and transaction traces. The default value of attribute enabled is true. databaseNameReporting Use this sub-element to enable collection of the database name on slow query traces and transaction traces for some database drivers. The default value of attribute enabled is true. queryParameters Use this sub-element to enable collection of the SQL query parameters on slow query traces. The default value of attribute enabled is false. Caution Recording query parameters may capture sensitive information. The transactionTracer.recordSql configuration option must be set to raw or this option is ignored. Distributed tracing The distributedTracing element is a child of the configuration element. <distributedTracing enabled=\"false\" excludeNewrelicHeader=\"false\"/> Copy Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. Enabling distributed tracing disables cross application tracing, and has other effects on APM features. Before enabling, read the planning guide. Important Requires .NET agent version 8.6.45.0 or higher. The distributedTracing element supports the following attributes: To enable or disable, see Enable distributed tracing. enabled Type Boolean Default false Alternatively, enable distributed tracing via the NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true Copy excludeNewrelicHeader Type Boolean Default false By default, supported versions of the agent utilize both the newrelic header and W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. The newrelic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that don't support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over newrelic headers for distributed tracing. If you do not want to utilize the newrelic header, setting this to true will result in the agent excluding the newrelic header and only using W3C Trace Context headers for distributed tracing. Distributed tracing reports span events. Span event reporting is enabled by default, but distributed tracing must be enabled for spans to be reported. To disable span events, choose one of the following options: Disable span events via config file Set the <spanEvents> element to false to disable via the newrelic.config file. This element is a child of the <configuration> element. <configuration . . . > <spanEvents enabled=\"false\" /> </configuration> Copy Disable span events via environment variable Set the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED environment variable in the application's environment. NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_ENABLED=false Copy Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing extends the distributed tracing service by employing a trace observer that is external to the agent. It observes 100% of your application traces across various services and provides actionable data so you can solve issues faster. To turn on Infinite Tracing, make sure you have .NET agent version 8.30 or higher, and enable distributed tracing. Then add the following additional settings: <configuration . . . > <distributedTracing enabled=\"true\" /> <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer host=\"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" /> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Important Infinite Tracing spans can be limited by the transactionTracer.maxSegments setting. The infiniteTracing element supports the following elements: trace_observer The trace_observer element identifies an observer host that is independent from the agent. For help getting a valid Infinite Tracing trace observer host entry, see Find or create a trace observer endpoint. The trace observer may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST environment variable as well. Important When configuring the trace observer, you should not supply the protocol as part of the host. For example, use myhost.infinitetracing.com instead of https://myhost.infinitetracing.com. Span events The spanEvents element is a child of the configuration element. Use spanEvents to configure span events. <spanEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>myApiKey.*</exclude> <include>myApiKey.foo</include> </attributes> </spanEvents> Copy The spanEvents element supports the following attributes: enabled Type Boolean Default true Enable or disable the event recorder. maximumSamplesStored Type Int Default 2000 The maximum number of samples to store in memory at a time. This may be configured using the NEW_RELIC_SPAN_EVENTS_MAX_SAMPLES_STORED environment variable as well. Important This configuration option is only available in the .NET Agent v9.0 or higher. attributes Use this sub-element to customize your agent attribute settings for span events. This sub-element uses the same settings as the primary attributes element: enabled, include, and exclude. Tip These attribute settings are specific to span events. Attribute settings may be applied globally to all event types to with this configuration setting. Capture HTTP Request Headers The allowAllHeaders element is a child of the configuration element. Set this to true to allow the .NET Agent to capture all HTTP request headers as request.headers.{http-header-name} attributes. Set this to false to only allow the .NET agent to collect the following HTTP request headers: request.headers.referer request.headers.accept request.headers.content-length request.headers.host request.headers.user-agent Copy enabled Type Boolean Default false Enable or disable HTTP request headers capture. Example: <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> </attributes> Copy Important The allowAllHeaders setting is only available in the .NET Agent version 8.40.0+. When using allowAllHeaders to capture attributes, the captured request header attributes are still being controlled by the root level and destination level attributes settings. Without setting the request.header.* in the include list under the attributes element (see the following), the .NET Agent still filters out all header attributes. The default newrelic.config is set to include the request.header.*. <allowAllHeaders enabled=\"true\" /> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.headers.*</include> ... </attributes> Copy The default newrelic.config is also set to explicitly exclude the following HTTP request headers to prevent the .NET Agent collecting unwanted data. <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>request.headers.cookie</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.proxy-authorization</exclude> <exclude>request.headers.x-*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Settings in app.config or web.config For ASP.NET and .NET Framework console apps you can also configure the following settings in your app's app.config or web.config, within the outermost element, <configuration>: Enable and disable the agent <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\" value=\"false\" /> </appSettings> Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled settings in these files will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.AppName\" value =\"Descriptive Name\" /> </appSettings> Copy License key <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\" value =\"XXXXXXXX\" /> </appSettings> Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. <appSettings> <add key = \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\" value=\"C:\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\newrelic.config\" /> </appSettings> Copy Settings in appsettings.json For .NET Core apps, you can configure the following settings in appsettings.json if the following is true: The appsettings.json file must be located in the current working directory of the application. The application must have the following dependencies: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables Enable and disable the agent { \"NewRelic.AgentEnabled\":\"false\" } Copy Important If the agent is disabled in the local or global newrelic.config, the NewRelic.AgentEnabled setting in this file will be ignored. Application name For more information, see Name your .NET application. { \"NewRelic.AppName\": \"Descriptive Name\" } Copy License key { \"NewRelic.LicenseKey\": \"XXXXXXXX\" } Copy Change newrelic.config location Designates an alternative location for the config file outside of the local root of the app or global config location. The location entered must be an absolute path. { \"NewRelic.ConfigFile\": \"C:\\\\Path-to-alternate-config-dir\\\\newrelic.config\" } Copy",

      "body": "Our REST API (v2) allows you to configure settings for alerts. The API Explorer also includes the curl request format, available parameters, potential response status codes, and JSON response structure for each of the available API calls. You can also create alert conditions in the UI. Important For infrastructure alerting, see REST API for infrastructure monitoring alerts. Available data and functions via API REST API functions Comments View account data In general, any role can use a user key or REST API key with GET > List functions to view alerts data. The account Owner and Admins may use their API key. List output will be paginated. Available functions include: Alert policies Notification channels Conditions for APM, browser, and mobile (Some limitations apply.) Conditions for external services Conditions for synthetic monitoring Conditions for Multi-location synthetic monitoring Conditions for NRQL (Some limitations apply.) Events Violations Incidents Maintain account data You may have an Owner or Admin role in your account and a user key or have a custom role that grants permissions to manage Alerts and a user key in order to use any maintenance function, including POST > Create, PUT > Add, PUT > Update, and DELETE. Conditions excluded from the REST API These types of conditions do not have available endpoints in the API: APM: Web transaction percentiles, conditions targeting labels, and baselines NRQL: Baselines Alert policies These API functions include links to the API Explorer, where you can create, delete, or list policies. Important If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Create new policies To add new policies, use your user key and include these two values in the API call: Required values Definition Incident incident_preference Determines how Alerts will create incidents and group violations. This must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name The policy name is required. Leaving it unchanged will create a policy called string. API Explorer: Alerts Policies > POST > Create curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_policies.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"policy\": { \"incident_preference\": \"string\", \"name\": \"string\" } }' Copy Update policies Use this API to update an existing policy's name and incident_preference. You'll need your user key. Required values Definition id Required. To find a policy's ID, use either of these options: From the UI: On a policy's UI page, find the ID under the policy name. With the API: Use the List policies API. Incident incident_preference Determines how alerts will create incidents and group violations. Must be one of the following: PER_POLICY (default): Roll up by policy. PER_CONDITION: Roll up by condition. PER_CONDITION_AND_TARGET: Roll up by target and condition. Policy name Required. If you do not change the name, it defaults to a policy called string. To find a policy's exact name, use the List policies API.

Ideally, one line or less on the \"View all methods\" page. Requirements Agent version 1.2.3.4 or higher. Additional requirements on their own line (do not use bullets). Do not use any callouts. If there are no special requirements, write: Compatible with all agent versions. Description Describe the behavior of the call with as much detail as possible. Do not describe what individual parameters do except in broad strokes; details of parameters and call variants belong under the Parameters heading. Similarly, do not describe return values. When cross-referencing another API call, format its name with code blocks, and include parentheses () like this: anotherCoolMethod(). Tip You can include callouts, but use discretion. These pages are already visually busy. Parameters If there are no parameters, leave this section blank. If there is only one call variant, do not include a syntax block in this section. Parameter Description newrelic.apiStyleGuidelines(data type $parameter_name[, integer $optional_param]) Copy $parameter_name data type Required. Brief description of parameter. $optional_param integer Optional. Brief description of parameter. newrelic.apiStyleGuidelines(data type $parameter_name, array $different_param) Copy $parameter_name data type Required. Brief description of parameter. $different_param array Required. Brief description of parameter. $third_param string Required. Brief description of parameter. Return values What does this call return, and in what circumstances? Are there any things we expect customers to do with that return value? If the call does not return anything, leave this section blank. Examples This section documents rules for oddballs that aren't self-documenting. The rest of the examples are embedded within the page itself. In general, this page is intended for style reference. For examples of how to write good API method pages, check out our existing API docs, such as the PHP API. URL guidelines For the doc's URL: Manually edit the URL slug to remove the agent name. Where the API call does not already include separators (as in newrelic_awesome_call), separate the bits with hyphens -. For example: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-only/advanced-style-guide/writing-guidelines/api-style-guidelines Copy Title guidelines For the doc's title: Include the method name and the agent name in parentheses. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses () in the call itself. For example: apiStyleGuidelines (Example agent API) Copy Short title guidelines For the doc's short title: Include only the method name. Do not include newrelic. prefixes unless they are integral to the call name (as in the PHP agent). Do not include parentheses (). Adjust if necessary to fit on a single line in the category's sidebar. For example: apiStyleGuidelines Copy Syntax guidelines Important The Python and iOS agents use their own guidelines. For those guidelines, see the existing methods in those languages. Document each variant of a call on its own line. Do not use any formatting except italicizing the data type. Wrap optional parameters (including the comma separator) in square brackets []. Indicate the variable portion by prefacing it with a dollar sign $. If the call must be prefixed with newrelic. or similar, include that in the syntax. Optional: Include the return value, if that seems important for your particular agent. If you do, follow language conventions.",

      "body": "This document is a template for an API tutorial document: Please skim the entire template first to understand the expected structure for this type of doc. Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What New Relic products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. Optional: Troubleshooting Optional area for any common errors or troubleshooting tips.",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

      "body": "This is a template. Feel free to copy the formatting tips in this template to organize the docs you create on the docs site. Then replace the template information with your own text, lists, and tables as needed. Before you create sections, start your doc with a brief introduction, usually no more than a paragraph, that helps readers understand what your doc will cover. Your introduction (and the structure of your doc) should help readers understand within ten seconds whether they are in the right place. Section example Begin each section with a meaningful H2 title. The docs site uses these to generate the contents, which appears automatically in the left navigation. If you want to include a screenshot with the section, provide a permalink for the Docs team to create the image for you. Due to security requirements, the Docs team manages all images on the docs site. Code example def article_url(category, article, options={}) url_for(options.reverse_merge( :controller => 'articles';, :action => 'show', :category => category, :article => article )) end Copy List example For multi-step, actionable procedures, use ordered lists (ol in HTML or numbers in Markdown). For example: Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. For unordered lists, use bullets (ul in HTML or * in Markdown). For example: Black White For complex lists, consider using collapsers. Table example Tables help organize detailed lists so the information is easier to skim. Tables are easier to manage in HTML. For exammple: <table> <thead> <tr> <th width={200}> **Item** </th> <th> **Requirements** </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> Some thing </td> <td> More detailed information about it </td> </tr> <tr> <td> Another thing </td> <td> More detailed information about another thing </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Copy Tables created in Markdown use three or more hyphens --- to create each column’s header, and pipes | to separate each column. For example: | Item | Requirements ------------ | ------------ | Some thing | More detailed information about it | Another thing | More detailed information about another thing Copy",

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

The page that opens is index.js, the file that manages the parts of the home page, but not the content. It's rare that you'll need to make changes to this file. Most home page changes will be to add a new tile or section to the page, or update links. These types of changes are handled in two files: src/data/homepage.yml - contains home page section titles, section descriptions, and the URLs for tiles. src/i18n/translations/en/translation.json - contains tile info, including the title and short description of tiles. Update a link's URL Change or add new links using homepage.yml. In homepage.yml, search for the link you want to change. Edit the URL, save, commit, and PR the change. Add a new tile to the home page You'll make changes to both homepage.yml and translations.json On the translations.json doc, find the spot where you want to add the new tile (which section, and in what order you want it to appear), and add a new entry with this format: \"t#\": { \"title\": \"tile name\", \"description\": \"Short description.\" }, Copy Make sure you update the number on the tile. If you want to insert it in the middle of a group, update all the subsequent tile numbers as well. Save the file. Open homepage.yml, find the spot where the new tile will be, and add a new line with the relative link for the new tile. For example, - /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster Save and check that your new tile builds properly on a local build. Commit, push, PR when you're ready. Add a new section to the home page On the translations.json page, add a new section modeled in the spot where you want the new section to appear. Include at least one title. For example, here's the TDP entry, with one tile: \"errors-inbox\": { \"title\": \"Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers.\", \"t1\": { \"title\": \"Introduction to Errors Inbox\", \"description\": \"How to manage all your monitoring in one place.\" }, Copy When you're done creating the info, save the file. In the homepage.yml page, find the corresponding location for the new section, and add the short name you provided in the translation.json file, title, description, and tile URLs. For example, here's the corresponding TDP section on homepage.yml. errors-inbox: title: Errors Inbox description: A single place to proactively detect, triage, and take action on all the errors before they impact customers. tiles: - /docs/errors-inbox/errors-inbox Copy Save, build locally, commit, PR. Edit the home page left nav The left nav of the home page is controlled by src/nav/root.yml. This is a basic yml file, similar to our taxonomy files. Each link on the left nav needs a title and a path: - title: Welcome to New Relic path: /docs/using-new-relic - title: New Relic One path: /docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one - title: Guides and best practices path: /docs/new-relic-solutions - title: section-break - title: Alerts and Applied Intelligence path: /docs/alerts-applied-intelligence Copy You can add a new link by following the pattern above or delete a link by removing the corresponding title and path. Section breaks are added by including a - title: section-break line. The left nav reflects the exact order of root.yml, so it's easy to organize it as needed.",

For more information on related features, see our docs on Alerts notification channels, Incident Intelligence destinations, and Proactive Detection notifications. Alerts and Applied Intelligence notification integrations are specific services and platforms you can use to send notifications from New Relic. Integration details Read more about each of our specific notification integrations. Atlassian Jira Integrate New Relic with Atlassian Jira(Cloud) and automatically create and update Jira issues. Permissions The required permissions from the Jira API-Token are create, edit, and close tickets. To enable the two-way sync toggle, the provided Jira API-Key should have an Admin role. Set up a Jira destination Create Jira issues, then enable Jira and New Relic to share updates and stay synced. To create a Jira destination, enter the following information: Destination name: Custom name to identify the destination Jira account endpoint: the URL of the destination User-name: this will be the email address of the user making the connection API token: generated from your Atlassian account Important New Relic currently supports Atlassian-Jira Classic (company-managed) projects. Before saving the destination, we recommend you test the connection via the test connection button. Jira destination configuration. We recommand to test the connection before saving. Two-way sync You can enable a two-way integration with Jira to keep the issues' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. To enable two-way sync, turn on the ‘two-way integration’ toggle. When turned on, a Jira Webhook would be created in your Jira account at a later stage, for the selected project (see ‘customize a message template’). The webhook would contain access details to Newrelic (URL and Newrelic-API-KEY) Configure the message template To configure a template for a Jira issue, you first need to choose a destination. You will be able to create a new destination at this stage. Upon successful connection to the destination, you will need to choose a project, and then select the Jira issue type you would like to be used. Once the issue-type is selected, the configured project's fields are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your Jira instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Jira message template. Send a test notification You can see how the JIRA issue will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, a JIRA issue will be created and a link will appear. ServiceNow (Incident-Management) Integrate New Relic with ServiceNow Incident-Management and automatically create and update incidents. Roles As part of the integrations, we fetch fields from the your serviceNow incident table and optional values. For this, the provided ServiceNow user details required read permissions for the tables: sys_dictionary, sys_choice, sys_user and task. A read/write permission to incident To be able to fetch users for the caller column, we required read permissions for the sys_users table. The above permissions can be achieved with the roles personalize_choices, personalize_dictionary, rest_service, itil. Read/Write permissions to the api_key_credentials table is required to enable two-way integration. This can be covered with the roles credentials_admin and discovery_admin. Set up a destination To create a ServiceNow destination, enter the following information: Destination Name: custom name to identify the destination Domain: the URL of the destination User-name: the name of the user Password: the user name’s password Before saving the destination, we recommend testing the connection by clicking the test connection button. Two-way sync You can configure a two-way integration with ServiceNow Incidents Management to keep the incidents' state synced with the corresponding state in New Relic. Here are some required steps to remember when configuring the two-way integration: Turn on the two-way integration toggle. Open and download this XML file, which includes the business rule triggering events back to New Relic One. In the ServiceNow sidebar menu, go to System Definition > Business Rules. Click the menu icon in one of the column headers, select Import XML and upload the XML file you downloaded. Once the Destination is saved, a New-Relic API-Key will be kept in the api_key_credentials. The key would sent in a header as part of the callback REST call to New-Relic Configure the message template Upon a successful connection, ServiceNow incident table columns are fetched from your account and automatically mapped to your ServiceNow instance. To help you get started, we automatically present the required and recommended fields and values. Required fields must be set with a value. You can add or remove optional fields(use the X mark on their right side) Select, edit or remove fields for the ServiceNow-Incident template. Send a test notification You can see how the ServiceNow incident will appear by clicking a test notification with default field values. If successful, an incident will be created and a link will appear. Slack Send notifications-messages to your Slack channels. Prerequisites Your Slack workspace needs to have the New Relic application installed. The application must be approved by a workspace admin before it can be individually installed by users Set up a Slack destination Click on the `one-click Slack authentication' will lead you to the Slack landing page to continue the OAuth2 authentication process. On the Slack landing page, if you're not signed into the required workspace, you're redirected to Slack to sign in. Add your workspace name or select the relevant workspace and click Continue. When signed in to the selected workspace, you are requested to allow New Relic to perform the specified actions. Clicking `Allow' will redirect you back to the Destination page. Configure the Slack message settings Select a Destination(Workspace) and select a Slack-channel where the messages will be sent. You can create a new destination if there is no pre-defined destination for the required workspace. Note that, for privacy reasons, users need to be authenticated to select private channels (one-time process) Send a test notification You can send a test notification with a pre-defined example payload to the channel. This creates a message in the selected Slack-channel. Webhook Use the webhook notifier to send the notification messages to any endpoint you like. Set up a webhook destination To create a webhook destination, you need the following: Destination Name: A unique destination name URL: the endpoint of the target application, authentication and custom headers if needed. Authorization mechanism (Optional):. Can be basic authentication or a bearer token Configure the webhook event template Pick a webhook destination from the list and configure the HTTP-POST request. The request configuration requires you to: Set a name for the template. Select a pre-configured destination from the destinations list or create a new one. Add custom headers (optional). Configure the request’s payload. Customize the webhook payload You can use the default payload or customize it to contain the required data. Pick Variables from the variables menu and apply handlebars syntax to enrich your webhook. Note that the request’s content-type is JSON by default. Hence, the payload needs to keep the JSON form. See Usage examples The ‘preview’ section on the right hand-side shows an expected payload after the template is rendered. If the eventual payload would not form a valid Json, an error will be shown and it won’t be possible to save the template. If the webhook payload conforms a valid Json, you can send a test notification to your defined webhook destination We recommend sending a test notification to make sure that everything's connected correctly. Email Send email notifications to users. Configure the email settings Add one or more recipients. Users with New Relic accounts can be found via autocomplete when searching for their name or email address. To add a user without a New Relic account or email distribution list, add the full email address. Every recipient will be translated into a 'destination'. You can follow the email notifications per destination in the notifications-log Send a test notification You can send a test notification to make sure the email notifications reach the inbox.",

      "body": "Our automated user management allows allows you to import and configure your New Relic users from your identity provider via SCIM. This guide provides Okta specific details on how to configure the New Relic Okta SCIM/SSO application. Requirements Before using this guide, read the automated user management requirements. Note that these instructions require going back and forth between your identity provider and New Relic. Step 1. Create authentication domain and enable SCIM To get to the New Relic authentication domain UI: From one.newrelic.com, click the account dropdown, click Organization and access, and then click Authentication domains. If you don't already have one, create a new authentication domain for your SCIM-provisioned users by clicking + Add new. For that authentication domain, under Source of users, select SCIM. Copy and save the API token for later use. Note that this will be shown only once. Step 2. Set up Okta's New Relic app Next, set up Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application: Go to okta.com/ and sign in with an account that has administrator permissions. From the Okta home page, click on Admin. From the Okta admin Dashboard, choose the Applications page. Click Browse app catalog and search for \"New Relic by organization\" (not \"New Relic by account\") and choose that from the results. From the New Relic by Organization page, click on Add. From the Add New Relic by organization page, check the two Application visibility \"Do not display...\" checkboxes and click on Done. We will make the application visible later after configuration is complete and provisioning has begun. Step 3. Configure provisioning Configure Okta's New Relic SCIM/SSO application to automatically provision your users to New Relic: From the app, click on the Provisioning tab. From the Integration form, click on Configure API integration and check the Enable API integration checkbox. Take the API token you saved in Step 1 and input it in the Okta New Relic app's API token field. Optional: click on Test API credentials to verify a SCIM connection can be established to New Relic. If a connection can be established, a success message is displayed. If a connection was not established, re-enter the API Token and try the test again. Click Save. Note that the save process does a test of the API credentials. If a connection is not established to New Relic, the save will fail. On the newly displayed To App form, click on Edit. Check the Enable checkbox in the Create users, Update user attributes, and Deactivate users sections. Click Save. Go to the Sign on tab. In the authentication domain field, input your authentication domain ID, which you'll find in New Relic's authentication domain UI. Step 4. Assign users and groups If you don't already have your user groups set up in Okta, you'll need to create them. These will be the groups that you'll later assign access grants to in New Relic, which will be what gives those groups access to specific roles on specific accounts. To learn how to create groups, see Okta's documentation on groups. Assignments tab Next, you'll assign users. Assigning users is done using two different tabs in the app. We recommend having your New Relic users selected on the Assignments tab and their associated groups selected on the Push groups tab. In the app, click on the Assignments tab. From the Assignments form, click on Assign. From the pop up menu, click on Assign to groups. From the Assign ... to groups form, click on Assign for the group you wish to assign to the application. Highly recommended: Set your users' time zones in Okta. The time zone affects how date/times for that user are shown in New Relic. Users without a time zone configured will be shown in UTC time in New Relic. Time zone is specified in IANA Time Zone database format, also known as the \"Olson\" time zone database format (for example, \"America/Los_Angeles\"). There are several ways in Okta to assign users' time zone, so consult the Okta docs for more information if needed. Here is one way to do this in the Assignments tab: In the Time zone field, enter the default time zone for members of the group. Click on Save and go back. Repeat the steps to add a group until all desired groups have been assigned to the application. Click Done. Push groups tab In the app, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, click on Push groups. From the pop up menu, click on Find groups by name. From the Push groups to... form, in the search field enter the first few characters of the name of the group you want to send to New Relic. Leave the Push group memberships immediately checkbox checked. Click on your group in the pop up search results list. In the Match result & push action section, No match found should be displayed, meaning that the group does not yet exist at New Relic. Leave the selector set to Create group and leave the default name for the group. The intent here is to have a group of the same name created at New Relic. If this is the last group you wish to send to New Relic, click on Save. Otherwise, if you have more groups to configure, click on Save & add another and repeat the steps to add a group. When you've added one or more groups, you should be able to see the users you've added by going to the User management UI page. Step 5. Set your users' user type When your users are provisioned in New Relic, you're able to see them in the User management UI. If you're adding users to New Relic via SCIM but not managing their user type via SCIM, they start out as basic users. To convert users to full platform users, you have two options: Use the User management UI to edit users. Manage user type from Okta (described below). To manage your users' user type from Okta: Go to the New Relic authentication domain UI and click Enable Manage user type with SCIM. Note that when this is enabled, you can’t manage user type from the New Relic UI and can only manage it from Okta. Go into your Okta instance. The rest of these instructions are done from Okta. Next, you'll configure Okta to be able to send a new attribute nrUserType. Steps: Go to the Profile editor. In the Attributes section, click Add attribute. Set your settings to match the screenshot below. The only two fields that must match exactly are External name (value: nrUserType) and External namespace (value: urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:extension:newrelic:2.0:User). The variable value can be any value. Next, you'll configure your Okta user profile to have this field. Steps: In the Profile editor, go to Users and click the User (default) profile. Add a new New Relic user type attribute to that profile (see Okta user profile instructions). How you set this will depend on your own setup and preferences for defining user type. Note that the expected values for user type are Basic user for basic user and Full user for full platform user. Below is an example with information filled in. In the People section, define the user type for your users. How you do this will depend on your setup and preferences. For example, you may choose to set this manually by setting each user’s user type, or you may use Okta to manage these in bulk. Next, you’ll set up mapping for that attribute. Steps: In the app's Provisioning section, click Unmapped attributes. Go into edit mode for the unmapped New Relic user type attribute. Configure it based on how you want to set the user type. To learn about why you'd set them as basic users or full platform users, see User type. Learn more about Okta attribute mappings. Step 6. Assign access grants Once these steps are completed, you're able to see your users in New Relic by going to the User management UI. Now that your users are present in New Relic, you must grant them access to specific roles on specific accounts. If this is not done, your users don't yet have access to New Relic. To learn how to do this, see: How access grants work The user management tutorial Step 7. Configure SAML SSO To enable SAML SSO, see the SAML instructions. Additional considerations In this section we discuss other important things to know when using the New Relic SCIM/SSO application. This section includes tips to work around potential issues that could cause undesired results when integrating between Okta and New Relic. Moving users between groups When moving a user between groups, you must manually synchronize the old group's membership with New Relic. This is because Okta does not send a SCIM request to remove a user from a group. So, the admin needs to push the old group's membership to New Relic manually to inform New Relic that the user is no longer a member of the old group. Here are the steps to manually synchronize a group's membership: From the New Relic SCIM/SSO application page, click on the Push groups tab. From the Push groups form, open the pick list on the desired group's button under the Push Status column. From the displayed pick list on the button, click Push now. This causes an immediate synchronization of the group's membership with New Relic.",

      "body": "For New Relic organizations on the New Relic One pricing model, several factors impact your costs: which edition you're on (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise), how many billable users you have, and how much data you ingest. This resource will help you estimate your New Relic data ingest costs. Best option: extrapolate usage from a test New Relic account Before getting started, note that you can sign up and use New Relic for free, without ever putting in a credit card. We give you full visibility on your data ingest, so it's easy for you to figure out where data is coming from and adjust your data ingest as you go. Data ingest rates can vary from one New Relic organization to the next, based on what kinds of things are monitored, what features are used, the monitored applications' behaviors, and more. Given that variability, the best option is to set up a test New Relic account and then extrapolate your usage from that. If you can't or don't want to set up a test account, use the cost estimator spreadsheet. Here are some tips for extrapolating usage from a New Relic account: If you’re just signing up to New Relic, consider creating a test installation with an environment similar to what you’ll need moving forward. Then use the baseline ingest from the trial to extrapolate what your full environment would require. To do this, create a new free account, and use our instant observability options to get started reporting data. Note that APM, infrastructure monitoring, and logs tend to produce the bulk of most customer's data, but that can vary. If you’re an existing customer, use consumption info from the data management hub or by querying your data ingest to estimate new or added ingest. Use the cost estimator spreadsheet If you don't wish to create a test New Relic account, you can use our cost estimator spreadsheet. To get started, make a copy of this Google spreadsheet. The instructions below will give you instructions on how to fill out the spreadsheet, which will auto-populate an estimated cost. Note that the spreadsheet provides you only an estimate: it is not a binding billing proposal. To arrive at the ingest rates used in the estimator, we analyzed about 10,000 existing New Relic organizations of various sizes to arrive at the ingest rates used in our calculations. Note that you get 100 GBs of data ingest per month for free. The following sections explain how to use the various parts of the spreadsheet. Size your APM agent ingest Ingest rates are measured per agent, not per host. You might have multiple agents monitoring a single host. In the APM data volume section of the spreadsheet, you estimate whether you have low, medium, or high ingest rates from APM agents. We’ve built an average of the data volume for all APM agent types into the spreadsheet calculator. When filling out this section, consider these questions: How many APM agents will you deploy? What types of applications will you monitor? Understanding how the application is used and the application complexity is important. For example, e-commerce apps will have much higher throughput than an internal application. Will you use features that contribute to higher ingest rates? See the criteria questions that follow for more detail. Criteria for calculating ingest rates per APM agent In general, use higher ingest rates for applications that are integration/business tiers, large business-to-consumer (B2C) sites, or have significant custom instrumentation or metrics. That means, select High in these cases: For app behaviors and environments where you expect high throughput and a high number of errors, and the app is in a production environment. For complex app architectures (for example, a single front-end request spawns multiple back-end requests). If you have a high number of key transactions. If you have custom instrumentation and APM metrics. For transactions with a lot of attributes. Add APM agent ingest to the spreadsheet: Add the number of APM agents that you will monitor. Approximate the amount of ingest you’ll need for your agents and select one of the options. In general, if you’re on the Standard pricing edition (the edition new organizations start at), you can probably select Low: For how to manage your data ingest, see Manage data ingest. Size your infrastructure agent ingest Sizing your infrastructure monitoring data ingest depends on the number of agents and integrations you have, and how much data they're each reporting. When calculating the volume of your infrastructure ingest, take into account: How many infrastructure agents do you think you'll need? Which integrations contribute to higher ingest rates? The following are some approximate sizes. You should also take the size of your environments into account. If they’re very large, for example, these rates might not be accurate. On-host integrations (low) Cloud integrations (low to medium) Kubernetes integrations (medium to high) Add infrastructure agent ingest to the spreadsheet: At step 3 in the spreadsheet, input your estimated number of infrastructure agents. To determine this, decide how many hosts you’ll run infrastructure agents on. At step 4, assign a size for the volume of your infrastructure: Start with your base ingest rate as Low if you'll have only a few on-host integrations. Adjust to medium or high depending on how many and how high the volume of your integrations. Consider whether you have cloud integrations with large footprints, or a large number of database on-host integrations, or multiple or large Kubernetes clusters. For example: If running two or more low or medium impact integrations such as cloud or on-host integrations, choose Medium ingest rate. If running all three types of integrations (oh-host, cloud, containers) or observing really large Kubernetes environments, choose High for your ingest rates. For how to manage your data ingest, see Manage data ingest. Size your log data ingest For this section, you add an estimated amount of ingest in gigabytes. When estimating log data ingest: Use current logs volume. For example: Pull information from existing ELK, Splunk, or Sumo storage and divide by total months that data is currently retained to get a per-month rate. Multiply your average log file size by the number of logs you use, and extrapolate to get a per-month rate. Subtract security (PCI/HIPAA) and audit logs. Generally, 40-50% of current ELK, Splunk, and Sumo storage is used for troubleshooting. Understand your retention requirements. Typically, troubleshooting logs are not that valuable after 30 days of retention. In section 5, add your estimated monthly log data ingest, in GB. You can estimate this as 40-50% of your existing ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, or Sumo data ingest. For how to manage your data ingest, see Manage data ingest. Add additional retention You can adjust the baseline data retention settings for each data source. To learn about retention and the baselines, see Data retention. Retention considerations: For each additional month (30 days) of retention, the cost is $0.05 per GB ingested per month. Retention is added evenly across all namespaces up to a maximum of 395 days. Retention cannot be extended for just one namespace (for example, just logs or custom events). The increased rate is applied to all ingested data. In section 6 of the spreadsheet, select the additional months of retention that you want. View the calculated estimate When you complete the extended retention section, the total estimated price is displayed in the Calculations section of the spreadsheet. Other potential data ingest costs Because this billing calculation was designed for newer customers, it uses the implementations and costs that our newer customers often have. For example, we haven’t provided cost estimates for browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, network performance monitoring, or other services. (Maybe worth noting: neither our basic alerting features nor our synthetic monitors contribute to data ingest.) For many organizations, these other costs will often represent only 5% or so of the costs examined and calculated in the spreadsheet. But be aware that high levels of data ingest by other tools can make that higher. Other billing factors Data ingest is one billing factor for New Relic One pricing.

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, the folder/file structure, and more. For brief instructions for common use cases, see Procedures, but if you're doing larger docs site projects, it's recommended you understand the general concepts beforehand. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Doc files: All the docs are represented by .mdx files, also known as markdown files. Nav files: The nav files are what govern the displayed structure of the docs site, as exposed in the docs site left sidebar. The nav files are yaml files located in the nav directory. Folder: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content directory). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar structure is determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or sub-category: we use these words fairly interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, we might refer to the \"Accounts\" category, or the \"Manage data\" category. Auto-index pages (deprecated): This refers to a previous implementation where users could load views of the docs in a specific category (for example, by clicking a category heading in the sidebar). We no longer support this implementation. Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure in the sidebar. The displayed structure seen in the sidebar is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the structure displayed in the sidebar without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely equivalent. Because these two things are separate, this can mean that there can be some unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes. This means that when you move a doc file, you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL. This means you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls the displayed structure of docs you see in the sidebar. Currently there are multiple nav files, one for each major section of docs. For example, there's a nav file for \"Accounts\", which contains organization- and account-related settings. And there's a nav file for \"Infrastructure monitoring.\" For more on nav file format, see Nav file format What governs how a sidebar displays? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure (which is governed by the nav files) is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL across all the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. A doc's URL may exist in more than one nav file. Currently, it's a rule that a doc can only be located in one place across all nav files. But we still have some docs that exist in multiple nav files. For those cases, our site attempts to find the appropriate nav file by choosing the nav file that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with the relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents pages: - title: Agent data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc. Each nav file's top level title also has a path. Do not use trailing slashes. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. If you're doing a larger docs project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the general docs site structure concepts. Procedures include: Overview of what a large docs site restructuring involves Add a new docs category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create dummy docs Overview of steps for a large docs site restructure project For some smaller docs site edits, you can sometimes simply edit the nav files and not have to touch the doc files or folders. But for larger projects, you may want to or need to edit and move the docs files and folders themselves. Below is a broad overview of the chunks of work such larger projects generally entail. Plan out what the new nav file structure will look like, and plan out the work of moving docs files or creating new folders. It can help to write down the chunks of work a large project will entail. Move the affected doc files to their new folder locations, making sure to add redirects. For more on that, see Move docs between folders. Delete any empty folders. For any folder or file edits you do to the file structure itself (including file or folder renaming, moving files and folders, but not including editing of content or front matter within a doc or nav file), do the same edits to the folders and files in the i18n directory. Not all folders or files will be present in the i18n directory: it only populates an mdx file or an associated folder if that mdx file has been marked for translation. Edit the nav files to reflect the new desired structure and point to the new doc URLs. For more specific and granular procedures, keep reading. Add a new category of docs We'll explain two procedures: adding a sub-category of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file: Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title. Add the docs you want in that section, emulating the format and indenting of other nav files. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. Adding new nav files should get sign-off from a docs site manager. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the standard nav file formatting and indenting. For more on structure, see nav format. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in a nav file. Do not place a doc in more than one nav file location: if you require a link to a doc from a different category, attempt to place that reference within a relevant doc section. To add a doc to a nav file: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the standard nav file formatting and indenting. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file Move a doc in the nav file when you want to change where it's visible in the sidebar menus. To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure the formatting and indenting match standard nav file structure. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move a doc between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming quite divergent, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create user confusion (for example, when the elements of the folder-based URL are very different than the nav-file-based location) or sub-optimal search engine results. Too much divergence can make it harder for us to find and edit docs, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL (for more on why, see Understand structure). Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file name and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about our scripts for programmatically adding redirects to an entire doc directory. Be sure that redirect URLs don't have a trailing slash. Move the doc to its new folder location. If that mdx file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if it's marked for translation), make an equivalent move of that file in the i18n directory. Update nav files with the new URL. Having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc's URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete or rename a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete or rename the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. Instructions for this: Because moving a folder or changing its name results in changing all the URLs of docs in that folder, you must first add redirects to the affected docs. You can do this manually (described in step #1 here) or you can use a script the docs team has for bulk-adding redirects to all the docs in a directory. Make the desired edit. For example, move the folder to the new location (dragging and dropping in the Finder window, for example), and/or rename the folder. If the edited folder is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if a doc in that folder has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that folder and its files in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: adding redirects for the mdx files being moved or deleted, then moving or deleting the docs, and then deleting the empty folders. Change a doc's file name Changing an mdx file's name results in its URL changing. Note that you can change a doc's displayed title in its front matter without changing the actual file name. Changing the file name can be useful. Instructions: Add a redirect to the doc whose file name you're changing. Change the file's name. If that file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if that doc has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that file's name in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. Create \"dummy\" docs We no longer want to have docs in multiple places in the nav files (although we still do have some docs that are like this). If you want a doc to be referenced in more than one location in the nav files, instead attempt to find a place within a doc where it makes sense to reference that doc.",

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performance and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service response time Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (such as health checks) are not included or measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. Additional resources Need help getting started?

      "body": "Overview \"Do I have all the telemetry I need to adequately measure my service?\" The process of onboarding a service for production monitoring tends to start from the end and work its way to the beginning. Typically, a service is instantiated with agent based monitoring and the team responsible for service delivery needs to read the telemetry coming out of the agent like tea leaves. They work their way backward to understand how the service functions by what can be observed. At New Relic, through tens of thousands of observability deployments, we have discovered that the more involved designers, architects, and developers can be in the definition of optimal service delivery measurement, the better. The emergence of the IT aphorism shift left speaks to the need to involve developers more directly in the software lifecycle activities that happen after the development stage is complete. In the case of service observability, we find there is little specific guidance on how developers can meaningfully contribute to production telemetry definitions. This guide is intended to provide practical suggestions for developers to evaluate the state of your telemetry and suggest paths to improve it. Observability programs that closely link developer expectations with the runtime behavior of production systems are much more effective to diagnose and remediate aberrant conditions. The closer developer connection also produces services that are more robust and performant. You’re a good candidate for service characterization if any of the following are true: Your development teams are disconnected from production observability design. Your production monitoring program suffers from a lag between the introduction of new services/capabilities and their coverage with telemetry and alerting. You need to provide additional business context to your instrumentation for diagnosis and business KPI measurement. You employ a highly customized or proprietary software framework. Your service is under active development. Legacy services, and services built from commercial-off-the-shelf platforms tend to be better served with generic instrumentation options. Desired outcome This guide focuses on the metrics derived from your service’s runtime operation (its code execution) as well as external measurements of execution (through synthetic testing). Service instrumentation planning is the approach used to describe a single service runtime through telemetry. Modern monitoring systems provide deep insight into the technical details of service implementation. The power of distributed trace or bytecode instrumentation allows operations teams to quickly collect detailed service telemetry. Unfortunately, operations teams are often not in the best position to evaluate the quality of the telemetry gathered from the instrumentation. This challenge is compounded by the fact that service delivery teams are asked to implement telemetry collection for the first time in live production systems. Exposing inadequately instrumented services to production users for the purposes of refining that instrumentation creates a period that puts customer satisfaction at risk. This burn-in period often becomes difficult to escape as new features are delivered from code bases without a strong linkage between software delivery and observability programs. By having your development staff involved in improving your service instrumentation, you should realize observability benefits in the following ways. Better informed development decisions by: Detecting areas of volatility or unexpected behavior and addressing them. Understanding what dependencies in your code lack redundancy or robustness, and taking measures to refactor the service. Appreciating how end-user cohorts are employing your software. You can better understand where improvements will have the biggest impact. Improved troubleshooting: More precise and contextually relevant telemetry from your service will allow for more accurate and actionable detection of faults. With better telemetry naming, operations staff can use a common language with developers during incidents, reducing the time to triage and remediate incidents. Key performance indicators It is important to identify some simple KPIs that help to gauge the ongoing improvements in your software delivery and operations programs. The following outlines some suggested KPIs to consider as you invest in improved instrumentation. Business KPIs are aligned to your overall program objectives and should be consistently measured to demonstrate ongoing program improvement for each service. Practitioner KPIs are used to measure changes in the execution of job functions for those participating in the development and management of services. Business KPIs Service quality A metric is required to define how well your service is operating. This will depend upon the needs of your organization and the constraints of the services being monitored. Goal: Improved service quality attainment score over time. Best practices: Create a graphical representation as a trend of Service Quality achievement for defined periods (Monthly / Quarterly). Service Apdex can provide an effective Service specific quality score. (See Apdex: Measure user satisfaction.) A well defined Service Level Management (SLM) approach using SLIs that describe the level of expected operation for service boundaries can be a useful way to establish a single measurement of quality. Release frequency The number of releases for a given service. This should indicate the velocity of the software delivery organization. Often release frequency isn’t immediately comparable between development organizations. Instead, weighting high-value releases or features to bugs can provide an improved comparative context. Goal: Consistency of attainment with consistent or improving Service Quality indicator. Best practices: Can be derived from deployment markers or other events sent to New Relic. Measure directly from code or project management tools such as Jira, BitBucket, GitHub. Consider implementing a collection mechanism to capture release events and store them directly in New Relic. See NR1 CICD Innovation for example JIRA and BitBucket configs. Practitioner KPIs Feature release frequency Quantification of the percentage of releases that are directly related to new feature development versus bug fixes or technical debt retirement. The relationship to feature to fix will vary between teams and projects based on the history of the service. Goal: A consistent or improving feature release frequency consistent with the service delivery goals. Best practices: Practitioner feature release frequency is often acquired in the same manner as the broader release frequency business KPI. This metric is then made available to the development team for the service. Mean time to close Average duration of alert-driven incidents in New Relic. See Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide for more details. Goal: Steady decrease of incident close time for identified services. Best practices: Follow the Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide, understanding Service behavior through the lens of the alerts defined to help improve service delivery. Prerequisites Before you begin to introduce Service Instrumentation into your development processes, get acquainted with New Relic fundamentals available from New Relic University. In addition to NRU training, review and keep the following documentation resources handy: APM agent install and configuration Instrumentation guides: C-SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby OpenTelemetry SDKs Introduction to New Relic synthetic monitoring Establish current state Determine your instrumentation needs Understand endpoint testing Determine your instrumentation needs Instrumentation is the process to acquire telemetry from a software system and its associated services for the purpose of describing that software system's runtime behavior and business function. Monitoring systems tend to provide generic capabilities for telemetry acquisition that can be fine tuned to close gaps when monitoring the function of a software system. This use case assumes that your Observability Program has completed the Quality Foundation OMA use case implementation guide and that you have a well considered and deployed telemetry collection architecture for your services. With the possible exception of alert definition, instrumentation offers the most open-ended and customizable activities related to observability. The New Relic One platform provides features to highly customize your use of instrumentation. Because of this, you should carefully consider the amount of time and effort you’re going to put into instrumenting your services. Like all service instrumentation assets and dependencies, the introduction of instrumentation will require ongoing oversight and maintenance and therefore is a form of technical debt you will accrue for your project. As you begin the process of instrumentation, you want to continually ask yourself the question: Is the visibility I will gain from this instrumentation worth the cost of implementation and support? Decision matrix As a first step you should evaluate the default instrumentation you obtain from your Observability platform and ask yourself the question: Does the telemetry adequately describe the function and the purpose of my service? Think about what your service does. Perhaps it receives an order, needs to validate the order for integrity, conveys that order to a clearinghouse service, and receives a confirmation code that is relayed back to the requestor. This example gives a clear path to break down the function of service and evaluate if we have enough telemetry and context to make informed appraisals of how the service is functioning. Conceptual service that receives and processes http requests. If this conceptual diagram represents the implementation of the service, you need to know at any moment in time: How many requests do I receive? How many messages and HTTP requests do I send? How many requests are successful? What is the response time for a full request? What is the response time for invocation to a dependency? How much resource should this process take under what number of requests? What are all my points of failure? Most monitoring frameworks for application runtimes will gather telemetry like this as basic functionality. However, sometimes specific implementation of your service will pose a challenge to the generic instrumentation assumptions made by the monitoring software. In this case your Observability platform will need to accommodate your needs and provide an ability to modify a default monitoring configuration. The following table documents some additional situations where you would consider adding additional telemetry or metadata capture through instrumentation. The practices section that follows describes how to close those gaps to ensure your observability platform provides telemetry needed to manage your service. Considerations for instrumentation: Are my base telemetry requirements satisfied? If not, document the gaps and evaluate if they can be closed through custom configuration or additional instrumentation techniques. Can I isolate discrete user stories within the telemetry? If not, use trace capabilities of agents to capture the invocation of a discrete user story with adequate context metadata. Do I have insight into the parameters that are invoking user stories? If not, use custom attributes through agent SDKs to add context to the transactions and spans. Can I measure the major functional components of the software? If not, use instrumentation SDKs to create baseline metrics on a specific functional element of the code. (cache lookups, processing routines, or utility functions). Can I measure the client interactions from my code to external systems? If not, ensure requests and responses are encapsulated by component level tracking. If the client invocation is asynchronous, consider implementing distributed trace features to view the successive processing. Understand endpoint testing Endpoint testing is a simple and practical approach that greatly expedites how to determine the root cause of a given system failure. It allows operations and supporting teams to quickly know there is a real problem, and isolate that problem to a specific service. Modern software systems depend on a number of services to complete their tasks. Historically, the process of monitoring those service endpoints was straightforward. The architecture team would produce a well documented map of dependencies for the operations team. The operations team would dutifully create a check of the itemized endpoints. Today, with continuous delivery processes and small batch changes, new endpoints and dependencies can be created and deployed at a rate that makes it difficult for an operations team to anticipate and proactively define synthetic checks. By giving the service developers greater scope of control to define production services tests during the development phase, you will greatly increase the coverage of endpoint tests for your Observability program. Decision matrix To determine whether to create a synthetic check is straightforward. You will want to know the first occurrence of a failure for a dependency. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, consider creating a dedicated synthetic check. Is the end point customer facing? Does the endpoint invoke new dependencies? Is the endpoint on a different network infrastructure? Is the endpoint shared between multiple services? Is the endpoint a content origin supported by a CDN? Improvement process Config based instrumentation Isolate service functions Define custom transaction names Measure service components Ensure your frameworks are measured Track every external call Test your endpoints Config based instrumentation Each New Relic agent provides a variety of configuration options. Typically you will define a standard approach to include the agents within infrastructure hosts, application runtimes, and connections to your cloud service providers. Default agent configurations are generic and widely applicable. One of the best ways for developers to influence the applicability of deployment is by overriding the default configuration options for your service instance. The following are default instrumentation options to consider. Create an effective service name Tip New Relic agents provide a variety of mechanisms to define the Service runtime name. Please see the application naming guide to find the implementation details for your runtime environment. The name you give a service provides the namespace (where you will find the agent data). One of the most important strategies New Relic uses to understand the behavior of your services is to aggregate like things together and to use the commonalities derived from aggregation to isolate variance. Modern services are often deployed to multiple contexts to ensure capacity handling or specific functional segmentation. In order to take advantage of the benefits of aggregation, it is very important that your service runtimes are grouping instances with identical operational characteristics. Therefore, when deploying services, pay close attention to the following three criteria to help you name your deployed services: Does my service target a specific audience? Is my service running a different codebase? Is my codebase using a different runtime configuration? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider creating a unique name for your service. Audience criteria Think of the audience as the group of end users or service functions. If your service is split between North American and European deployments, the runtimes in those deployments should be grouped accordingly. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_AMER Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_EMEA Copy This will group the telemetry created by that audience together, allowing you to better understand the contextual similarities of service problems related to a specific user audience. Sometimes the way we deploy applications divides the operational context of a service, such as a portal application with administrative functions. Maybe the admin functions are baked into the general portal codebase, but only one instance in a cluster is handling the portal admin requests. In that case you have a functional audience segmentation opportunity, so you should ensure that it is named appropriately. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_ADMIN Copy Codebase criteria If you’re running different code versions under the guise of one service, consider segmenting those runtime instances and incorporating version naming as part of your naming scheme. When you group code together as one service name that is executing different service versions, you’re increasing the noise to signal ratio of any metrics you produce. Different code versions might use different amounts of compute resource or process data differently. It becomes very difficult to determine if a service is behaving normally when the signals you get from the metrics are due to different functional implementations. Consider adding a numeric identifier to the service name if you have multiple versions running concurrently. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V112 Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V115 Copy If you employ feature flag framework frameworks like LaunchDarkly or Split, you may have multiple versions of an application or service within a single codebase. Please consult the Isolating Service Functions section to address those conditions. Runtime criteria If an instance of a service is deployed to a system with different runtime constraints, it should be encapsulated in its own telemetry namespace. This can be a deployment to a different datacenter that offers network connectivity advantages to a shared resource, or perhaps the service is running on a separate compute tier with a different memory or thread configuration. These characteristics that affect the code runtime operation can cause different behaviors that lead to different operations behaviors. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_NYC_DC Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_REALLY_BIG_FOOTPRINT Copy Override default agent configuration Tip The New Relic agents provide a variety of options for runtime configuration. Please refer to the agent configuration guide for the options specific to your runtime. Each New Relic APM agent provides a variety of options to modify the default configuration. The most comprehensive and consistent location is the configuration file that accompanies each agent install. However, New Relic agents can also be configured by passing command line parameters directly to the service instance runtime, by using environment variables, or by calling functions within the agent's SDK at runtime. .NET agent configuration options: Using the New Relic .NET SDK API Environment variables Config file options Isolate service functions As the Create an effective service name section indicated, one of the primary objectives of instrumentation is to configure the New Relic agent to group like runtime constraints together as a single named unit. We suggest this because software systems should behave in deterministic ways. For a specific set of inputs, you should get an expected range of measurable outcomes. The degree to which we can comfortably contain these constraints into named service runtime components greatly helps us understand normal behavior and isolate aberrant behavior. Once you have settled on an effective service naming strategy, the next step is to look within the telemetry collected for the service and determine if it suitably isolates the service’s functionality. The implementation pattern we most often encounter is a series of functions being invoked by a web request. The initial receipt and handling of a web request to a service runtime results in the allocation of processing resources. New Relic defines this resource allocation and code execution as a transaction. The New Relic agent is configured with a set of assumptions that create namespaces for transactions as they are detected. Those assumptions differ between the agent language runtime. For example, a good example of how the New Relic Java agent determines the transaction name can be found in the Java agent's transaction naming documentation. However, even after the agent transaction naming protocol has been applied, it may leave you with an unsatisfactory result. By adding additional instrumentation to name the transaction to improve its context, this can greatly improve your understanding of the service’s execution behavior. The goal for transaction naming should be an APM transactions view that provides good segmentation of the services functions in an approach that is easy to understand for a non-developer. New Relic service transaction breakdown view. The transaction breakdown image is a good example of transaction segmentation. It provides detailed tracking of the amount of work being done by each transaction within the broader codebase of the service. It also displays the transaction with a plain user-friendly name that offers some hint of its business context (what the transaction does). As you learn more about naming transactions and including attributes, be sure to make your naming approach accessible for non-technical observers of the data. Transaction breakdown: the transactions in this service seem to be highly weighted to one transaction name with a pretty generic name. Breakdowns like this beg the question: \"Is this a good representation of the work my service does?\" The obtuse transaction breakdown image demonstrates a bad example of transaction name segmentation. In this case we have about 60% of the transaction volume being named OperationHandler/handle. Both the percentage attribution of the transaction volume and the generic nature of the name indicate there might be an overly zealous aggregation of transactions underneath that transaction namespace. A good way to validate your transaction naming approach is to review the distribution of response times for your transaction over a significant period of time in the service web transaction histogram dashboard. The service transaction histogram view shows the count of transactions that fall into each response time bucket. A good naming strategy tends to display a normal distribution. The service transaction image shows a wide range of transaction response rates. Although the bulk of the transactions land in the 0-200 millisecond range, it indicates values ranging from 200-1000 milliseconds. When you have a highly distributed range of responses for a transaction, you should ask yourself: What information do I have during the transaction execution that can help me name this transaction? In many cases, non-normal distributions are a direct result of the parameters being passed to a request, or the work the transaction is being asked to do. It is pretty easy to consider that a service query transaction might take a data range as a parameter. The date range when small might provide a faster lookup time. Therefore, perhaps providing a meaning scheme that is derived from some expected parameter constraints (> 1day, 1-5 days, >5 days) might provide a more meaningful segmentation. Your objective is to create a transaction name that facilitates grouping transactions with the fewest unique characteristics. A more normal distribution of transaction segmentation where individual transactions report more consistent response time attainment with fewer exceptions. The normal distribution image demonstrates more purposefully named transactions within a service. In this case the web transaction response times are more closely grouped, indicating consistent execution characteristics. By ensuring your transaction naming strategy provides a consistent mechanism to group your service’s functions by the types of operations they are performing, you will be able to quickly isolate aberrant behavior, or better understand the root cause of the variations. This will allow you to refactor your application and increase the overall predictability of your service’s functions. Define custom transaction names Tip Consult the New Relic agent API guide for your language agent to review the transaction naming procedure for your runtime. The New Relic agent transaction naming service requires the invocation of a SetName(String name) like API call to the New Relic agent SDK. Each language runtime agent has its own syntax and option for setting the name. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and use it to name a transaction in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Renaming transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Query Handler_\" + (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Please note: There is a maximum capacity to transaction names within New Relic. Your transaction naming strategy will have to trade off a degree of specificity if there are thousands of potential transaction names. When too many transaction names are being reported, New Relic will attempt to create rules to group those transaction names. More details can be found in the agent troubleshooting guide related to metric grouping issues. Should you suspect a metric grouping issue, open a support case with New Relic, and we will be happy to work with you to isolate the cause of the transaction naming issue. Capture parameters with your transactions Tip Consult the New Relic agent custom attributes guide for your agent language to review the metadata enhancement options for attribute customization. The transaction name is a powerful way for you to segment your Service’s functionality so that you can better understand its behavior. This allows you to discretely isolate functionality directly in the New Relic UI. However, there are many occasions when you will want to get some additional context on the function of your Service without resorting to isolating the transaction name. This can be accomplished by introducing attribute capture by your Service. You can add name:value pair attributes to decorate the details of each transaction. The attributes will be available in each transaction event through the APM transaction trace and errors UI, or through direct query of parameters from the NRDB transaction event type. After you select a transaction trace, you can view the custom attributes you have set for your Service’s transaction. Here is an example of the transaction trace details you can see in the APM errors UI. Custom attributes displayed in the APM errors UI. If you have developed a useful transaction name segmentation, you can use the additional context of the attributes to better understand the inputs, cohorts, or segments that led to an unexpected result. In addition to being able to understand the context of your transaction within the APM UI, the introduction of parameters is an extremely useful tool to aggregate and analyze transactions by querying transaction data directly. Custom attributes are added to each transaction, making it easy to isolate and facet on specific conditions. NRQL query expression that uses a custom attribute to facet database call duration. The parameter capture approach can also be used with feature flag systems like Split or LaunchDarkly. In this case, as you are implementing the decision handler for the feature flag, consider capturing the flag context (for example, optimized_version = on) that is being applied to the block of code controlling the version or feature the customer sees. NRQL query that demonstrates the result when the state of a feature flag is captured by a transaction custom attribute. The feature flag state attribute allows us to understand the impact of the code execution path on performance, throughput, and dependency utilization. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and save it as a custom attribute in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Adding an Attribute to transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"ImportantParm\", (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Measure service components The behavior of a specific transaction within the context of a service is a powerful way to segregate functionality and ensure a software system is operating effectively. However, another way to look at the behavior of a software system is to review the detailed component execution model of its implementation. The application framework code components are shared throughout the service, and the ongoing evaluation of component performance can provide an insight into the overall service health. Within New Relic One there are two places we can observe component execution details. The service summary dashboard in APM provides a view of the composite execution of the service broken down by its component parts (for example, garbage collection execution or database calls). This summary dashboard provides a breakdown of major component types within the application. Memcached, External Web Invocations, MySQL and Dirac are all examples of shared code frameworks that the collective transactions of the Service are using to execute their business logic. A similar breakdown is provided on a transaction by transaction basis. This single transaction summary view breaks out the contributing execution time by component. This helps you see the aggregate performance of components within a transaction. Transaction component segments will tend to demonstrate consistent performance behavior, you can use this consistency to detect a change in its fundamental behavior. This can be a good indication of an underlying issue. Resource constraints tend to manifest more obviously within component frameworks than within individual transaction details. This allows you to infer characteristics of dependencies through the common constraints being experienced by all code running within a service. Ensure your frameworks are measured Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find information about adding metric names to your instrumentation. The syntax for framework instrumentation is specific to the language your service is written in, but the general approach is consistent for all. Consider the threads of execution within your Services as an analogy for transactions within New Relic telemetry. Each method or function execution on the stack is an opportunity to add additional instrumentation. In this way New Relic maintains a time-annotated invocation stack for the transaction and uses those method/function start/stop timings to aggregate it into a series of component metrics. A simple Node.js application making a call to a MongoDB. The two major components of the application are the receipt of the request and get/put operations to the MongoDB. If a particular segment of logic is crucial to the function of your Service or transaction, consider wrapping that call with callbacks to the New Relic agent so that the agent can understand that it has entered a discrete code component and can aggregate the time consumed within that component accordingly. By passing a metric name to the callback, you will create a component segment metric for your service and transaction. The metric naming option is specific to the instrumentation language, so be sure to consult the specific language documentation. The New Relic agents allow you to specify a custom metric name for the instrumentation. The metricName will be used to determine the aggregated metric for the component. The following example demonstrates the metricName parameter being passed to a Java agent SDK @Trace annotation. @Weave public abstract class MQOutboundMessageContext implements OutboundTransportMessageContext { @Trace(dispatcher = true, metricName=\"MQTransport\") public void send(final TransportSendListener listener) throws TransportException { try { NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().setMetricName(\"Message\", \"MQ\", \"Produce\"); MQHelper.processSendMessage(this, NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod()); } catch (Exception e) { NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger().log(Level.FINE, e, \"Unable to set metadata on outgoing MQ message\"); } Weaver.callOriginal(); } } Copy Track every external service call Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find the details of client library instrumentation. Client instrumentation refers to encapsulating a call from your service to an external resource. Generally, New Relic agents are aware of clients popular for HTTP, gRPC, messaging, and database protocols and will apply the appropriate instrumentation pattern to aggregate calls to those clients as external services. External service dashboard details within New Relic APM. If you have written your own client handler for a protocol, or are using something very new or somewhat niche, the New Relic agent may not recognize the client and record the behavior of the client call. To this end you should verify the external services and databases within APM to represent all expected externalities for your service. Database protocol dashboard details within New Relic APM. It is important to validate that all your services' dependencies are represented here. If you do not see your service dependencies, you will need to introduce new instrumentation to intercept the external call so that your APM agent can track it accordingly. The following example demonstrates wrapping an external call in Golang for capture by the agent. package main import ( \"net/http\" \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic\" ) func currentTransaction() *newrelic.Transaction { return nil } func main() { txn := currentTransaction() client := &http.Client{} request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://www.example.com\", nil) segment := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, request) response, _ := client.Do(request) segment.Response = response segment.End() } Copy Examples of other agent API external call tracing: Go ExternalSegment Java ExternalParameters Python external_trace Test your endpoints Endpoint testing provides two benefits to your Service Instrumentation program. Defect detection: By encoding a test for an endpoint that produces a simple true/false result, it allows the operations team to isolate discrete failures to determine if the integrity of service delivery has been compromised. Baselining: Synthetic or machine tests provide a predictable set of conditions that allow you to evaluate the consistency of your service delivery from a control perspective. New Relic’s synthetic monitoring offers the ability to create a variety of testing types by employing an enhanced Selenium JavaScript SDK. Once a Selenium-based test script has been defined, New Relic will manage the location of the script execution as well as its frequency. New Relic synthetics launch dashboard. The synthetic test offers a variety of test options, each with its own focus. For more information see our synthetic monitoring documentation. From the perspective of a Service developer, the monitor type that is most frequently employed is Endpoint availability. This monitor type provides the ability to script http request conditions. These can be as simple as a POST or GET to an accessible API, or involve multiple steps where the Selenium monitoring script successively evaluates requests to ascertain functional integrity of a multi-step process. In practice, developers should consider implementing the simplest possible test to evaluate endpoint availability and integrity. For example, you have just created a new Service endpoint that provides the current exchange rate for a group of currencies. This is a simple GET at an endpoint that returns a JSON object array. Request example: http://example-ip:3000/exchange Response example: [ { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bf97f61c22f4fb5beb5c9\", \"name\": \"cdn\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:10:07.488Z\", \"__v\": 1 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb2a61c22f4fb5beb5ca\", \"name\": \"usd\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:14.224Z\", \"__v\": 0.80 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3261c22f4fb5beb5cb\", \"name\": \"eur\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:22.476Z\", \"__v\": 0.68 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3761c22f4fb5beb5cc\", \"name\": \"mex\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:27.009Z\", \"__v\": 15.97 } ] Copy In order for this service to be considered operational, it needs to respond to requests but also provide the four currency responses. We’re not worried about the content at the moment, just the fact we get four elements back in the array one, for each CDN, USD, EUR and MEX currencies. Using New Relic synthetic monitoring, an API test script could look like the following: /** * This script checks to see if we get the currency data from the endpoint. */ var assert = require('assert'); var myQueryKey = 'secret_key'; var options = { uri: 'http://example_ip:3000/exchange', headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; function callback (err, response, body){ var data = JSON.parse(body); var info = body; if (Array.isArray(data)) { if (data.length !== 4) { assert.fail('Unexpected results in API Call, result was ' + JSON.stringify(data)); } } } $http.get(options, callback); Copy The synthetics script can be directly configured in the New Relic interface, but we highly recommend you maintain your endpoint tests within your source repository system and employ automation. This will help ensure your endpoint testing accompanies the new endpoint dependencies that your Services introduce to production service delivery. Value realization The impact of Service Instrumentation will be directly related to the level of attention you’re willing to invest in overseeing the process. Like the process of monitoring services, your Observability program will benefit through a dedicated team function that thinks critically about its expectations of return for its investment in effort. Here is some guidance to think about the cost of investment for your organization and expectation of benefit. The following section outlines an approach for estimating the investments and returns you should expect by incorporating Service Instrumentation into your Observability practice. Investments Training Ensure all developers are familiar with New Relic agent SDKs and platform capabilities. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: Typically a number of hours for a developer to become effective using New Relic instrumentation features. Initial: 16 HRS Training / Exploration Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Review Per developer a yearly investment of 16-40 hours training to develop core skills and maintain skills currency for New Relic platform Development and maintenance The development effort required to implement and maintain instrumentation within a Service project. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: This tends to be dependent on the scope of the project and the amount of instrumentation work required. Initial: 8 HRS per developer per service Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Maintenance Per developer a project estimation of 16-32 hours developing and maintaining Service instrumentation Returns AQM impact Alert Quality Management delivers significant benefit to the operations team by ensuring the alert notifications from variant system performance are dealt with swiftly. This improves service delivery and resource allocation during incident remediation. An effective instrumentation practice federated into your observability program will greatly improve your team’s ability to create meaningful alerts. KPIs: Volume: Incident Count Volume: Accumulated Incident Duration Volume: Mean-Time-To-Close (MTTC) User Engagement: Mean Time to Investigate Outcomes: Less alert noise Greater alert and incident responsiveness Less unknown root cause Increased operations productivity Improved service delivery Service quality improvement Improving your service quality will have a direct impact on the key financial metrics for your Service. This will require that you have a well rationalized financial model for your application. Typically this return can be projected by associating a currency value for each percent improvement on a core service quality measure like errors or apdex attainment. As your investment in Service Instrumentation increases, you should see improved attainment on your service quality measures. KPIs: Service Quality (Business KPI) Outcomes: Decreased number of user impacting errors More performant and resilient Service components Service delivery improvement By providing better telemetry from your Service instances, your delivery organization should be able to more quickly detect volatility or downtime and remediate faster. This will lead to better overall service delivery KPIs and decrease episodes of outage or degradation. Cost can be associated with the amount of time it takes to detect, investigate and remediate an incident. This might be related to the value the Service provides your organization that will be lost during an event, or may be related to the general cost to deal with the poorly behaving Service. KPIs: Mean time to detect (MTTD) Mean time to identify (MTTI) Mean time to resolve (MTTR) Outcomes: Decreased time to detect incidents Decreased time to resolve incidents",

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending: Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities: Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review: Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations: In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? Do they have business impact? Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations: Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Incident volume Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT count(*) AS 'Incident Count' WHERE current_state='open' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT sum(duration)/(1000*60) AS 'Incident Minutes' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT average(duration/(1000*60)) AS 'Incident MTTC (minutes)' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration <= 5 * 60 * 100) AS '% Under 5min' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Incident engagement Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true.

      "body": "We use the data dictionary to provide information about data types (for example, Transaction, Metric, Log) and attached attributes. This is exposed in the New Relic query experience, on hovering over the data types and attributes. And we also expose the dictionary to the public. This doc contains info on how to add data to the dictionary. Note that currently we don't have infrastructure integration data in the dictionary. We also have very few attributes for the Metric data type, just a few basic default ones, despite there being many potential attributes attached to that data type depending on what the data source is. Data dictionary structure The data in the data dictionary is structured like this: Data types: sometimes called \"events\" for historical reasons, these are the NRDB data objects, like Transaction, Metric, Log, Span, etc. Attributes: these are key:value pairs attached to data types. One attribute can have multiple data types listed for it. For example, appName is on multiple data types. Data source: The New Relic product from which the data originates. With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter a commit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). If you'd like to go deeper with development, see our Contributors guide for information on how to fork our site, build it locally, and submit pull requests. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. Note that if a doc is marked for translation, we should also delete it in the i18n folder. To request us to delete something: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, the folder/file structure, and more. For brief instructions for common use cases, see Procedures, but if you're doing larger docs site projects, it's recommended you understand the general concepts beforehand. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Doc files: All the docs are represented by .mdx files, also known as markdown files. Nav files: The nav files are what govern the displayed structure of the docs site, as exposed in the docs site left sidebar. The nav files are yaml files located in the nav directory. Folder: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content directory). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar structure is determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or sub-category: we use these words fairly interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, we might refer to the \"Accounts\" category, or the \"Manage data\" category. Auto-index pages (deprecated): This refers to a previous implementation where users could load views of the docs in a specific category (for example, by clicking a category heading in the sidebar). We no longer support this implementation. Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure in the sidebar. The displayed structure seen in the sidebar is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the structure displayed in the sidebar without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely equivalent. Because these two things are separate, this can mean that there can be some unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes. This means that when you move a doc file, you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL. This means you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls the displayed structure of docs you see in the sidebar. Currently there are multiple nav files, one for each major section of docs. For example, there's a nav file for \"Accounts\", which contains organization- and account-related settings. And there's a nav file for \"Infrastructure monitoring.\" For more on nav file format, see Nav file format What governs how a sidebar displays? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure (which is governed by the nav files) is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL across all the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. A doc's URL may exist in more than one nav file. Currently, it's a rule that a doc can only be located in one place across all nav files. But we still have some docs that exist in multiple nav files. For those cases, our site attempts to find the appropriate nav file by choosing the nav file that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with the relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents pages: - title: Agent data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc. Each nav file's top level title also has a path. Do not use trailing slashes. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. If you're doing a larger docs project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the general docs site structure concepts. Procedures include: Overview of what a large docs site restructuring involves Add a new docs category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create dummy docs Overview of steps for a large docs site restructure project For some smaller docs site edits, you can sometimes simply edit the nav files and not have to touch the doc files or folders. But for larger projects, you may want to or need to edit and move the docs files and folders themselves. Below is a broad overview of the chunks of work such larger projects generally entail. Plan out what the new nav file structure will look like, and plan out the work of moving docs files or creating new folders. It can help to write down the chunks of work a large project will entail. Move the affected doc files to their new folder locations, making sure to add redirects. For more on that, see Move docs between folders. Delete any empty folders. For any folder or file edits you do to the file structure itself (including file or folder renaming, moving files and folders, but not including editing of content or front matter within a doc or nav file), do the same edits to the folders and files in the i18n directory. Not all folders or files will be present in the i18n directory: it only populates an mdx file or an associated folder if that mdx file has been marked for translation. Edit the nav files to reflect the new desired structure and point to the new doc URLs. For more specific and granular procedures, keep reading. Add a new category of docs We'll explain two procedures: adding a sub-category of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file: Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title. Add the docs you want in that section, emulating the format and indenting of other nav files. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. Adding new nav files should get sign-off from a docs site manager. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the standard nav file formatting and indenting. For more on structure, see nav format. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in a nav file. Do not place a doc in more than one nav file location: if you require a link to a doc from a different category, attempt to place that reference within a relevant doc section. To add a doc to a nav file: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the standard nav file formatting and indenting. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file Move a doc in the nav file when you want to change where it's visible in the sidebar menus. To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure the formatting and indenting match standard nav file structure. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move a doc between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming quite divergent, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create user confusion (for example, when the elements of the folder-based URL are very different than the nav-file-based location) or sub-optimal search engine results. Too much divergence can make it harder for us to find and edit docs, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL (for more on why, see Understand structure). Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file name and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about our scripts for programmatically adding redirects to an entire doc directory. Be sure that redirect URLs don't have a trailing slash. Move the doc to its new folder location. If that mdx file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if it's marked for translation), make an equivalent move of that file in the i18n directory. Update nav files with the new URL. Having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc's URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete or rename a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete or rename the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. Instructions for this: Because moving a folder or changing its name results in changing all the URLs of docs in that folder, you must first add redirects to the affected docs. You can do this manually (described in step #1 here) or you can use a script the docs team has for bulk-adding redirects to all the docs in a directory. Make the desired edit. For example, move the folder to the new location (dragging and dropping in the Finder window, for example), and/or rename the folder. If the edited folder is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if a doc in that folder has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that folder and its files in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: adding redirects for the mdx files being moved or deleted, then moving or deleting the docs, and then deleting the empty folders. Change a doc's file name Changing an mdx file's name results in its URL changing. Note that you can change a doc's displayed title in its front matter without changing the actual file name. Changing the file name can be useful. Instructions: Add a redirect to the doc whose file name you're changing. Change the file's name. If that file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if that doc has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that file's name in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. Create \"dummy\" docs We no longer want to have docs in multiple places in the nav files (although we still do have some docs that are like this). If you want a doc to be referenced in more than one location in the nav files, instead attempt to find a place within a doc where it makes sense to reference that doc.",

      "body": "These are some organization basics. Organize your page to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "This doc contains information and procedures pertaining to the structure of the docs site, including: the nav files, the sidebar, the folder/file structure, and more. For brief instructions for common use cases, see Procedures, but if you're doing larger docs site projects, it's recommended you understand the general concepts beforehand. Terms When talking about the docs site structure, sometimes people use different words for the same things. Below is a list of terms that can help us communicate about the docs site structure: Doc files: All the docs are represented by .mdx files, also known as markdown files. Nav files: The nav files are what govern the displayed structure of the docs site, as exposed in the docs site left sidebar. The nav files are yaml files located in the nav directory. Folder: In this context, \"folders\" refers to the actual docs site folder structure (those folders and files in the content directory). Referring to \"folders\" can be a helpful way to differentiate between the actual folder structure and the displayed structure that's set using the nav files. Sidebar: On public-facing docs, the sidebar is what is visible on the left hand side, showing the structure of that category of docs. The sidebar structure is determined by the structure set in the nav file. Category or sub-category: we use these words fairly interchangeably to refer to specific areas of the docs site. For example, we might refer to the \"Accounts\" category, or the \"Manage data\" category. Auto-index pages (deprecated): This refers to a previous implementation where users could load views of the docs in a specific category (for example, by clicking a category heading in the sidebar). We no longer support this implementation. Understand how the docs site structure works This section will explain some of the logic behind how the docs site structure is determined and how the structure we display to the public relates to the actual folder structure. How is the displayed structure related to the actual folders? The actual docs folder structure (the folders and mdx files in the content folder) is entirely separate from the docs site structure in the sidebar. The displayed structure seen in the sidebar is determined solely by the nav files (the yaml-format files in the nav folder). It's important to understand the above point. The divergence of the docs folder structure and the displayed docs site structure is necessary: we need a way to control the structure displayed in the sidebar without requiring us to keep the folder structure and folder names and doc file names completely equivalent. Because these two things are separate, this can mean that there can be some unintuitive aspects of how that logic works. We do have procedures for common use cases, but it will help you a lot to understand the specifics below of how the displayed structure is generated. What determines a doc's URL? Where a doc file (mdx file) is located in the content folder, and the associated folder and file names, are the only factors that govern that doc's URL. For example, consider the following doc file automated-user-provisioning-single-sign.mdx: This doc's URL is solely based on its folder location and the names of the folders. In this case, its URL is: docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/automated-user-management/automated-user-provisioning-single-sign Copy This has important implications, including: When you move a doc from one folder to another, its URL changes. This means that when you move a doc file, you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. If you rename an mdx file name or a folder name, that changes its URL. This means you must add a redirect to that doc of its original URL. What does a nav file do? The nav files are quite simple. A nav file controls the displayed structure of docs you see in the sidebar. Currently there are multiple nav files, one for each major section of docs. For example, there's a nav file for \"Accounts\", which contains organization- and account-related settings. And there's a nav file for \"Infrastructure monitoring.\" For more on nav file format, see Nav file format What governs how a sidebar displays? As stated above, the sidebar is just one way that the docs site structure (which is governed by the nav files) is exposed. When a doc is loaded, the docs site searches for that URL across all the nav files. If it finds a match, it displays that nav file in the sidebar with that doc highlighted. A doc's URL may exist in more than one nav file. Currently, it's a rule that a doc can only be located in one place across all nav files. But we still have some docs that exist in multiple nav files. For those cases, our site attempts to find the appropriate nav file by choosing the nav file that matches the top level category in the doc URL. For example, if a doc with the relative URL /docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/create-your-new-relic-account was in two nav files, the docs site code would search to see if one of the nav files has docs/accounts as its first path field. If it finds a match, it uses that nav file. Nav file format Below is a snippet of the agents.yml nav file. Note that the file has indentation that corresponds to the level of the navigation hierarchy. When making changes or creating a new nav file, be sure to use the existing spacing format. yml title: Agents path: /docs/agents pages: - title: Manage APM agents pages: - title: Agent data pages: - title: Real time streaming path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/real-time-streaming - title: Custom instrumentation path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation - title: Agent attributes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes - title: Custom events path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-events - title: Custom metrics path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-metrics - title: Manage errors path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected - title: Link Kubernetes path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/link-your-applications-kubernetes - title: App naming pages: - title: Name your application path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application - title: Use multiple names for an app path: /docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app Copy Tip Navigation nesting is currently limited to a maximum of six levels deep. Please reach out to the engineering team if that is not enough. Here are important elements of the nav file: Key Required? Description title yes The text shown in the navigation, either of a doc or a category. path yes The URL path to the doc. Each nav file's top level title also has a path. Do not use trailing slashes. rootNav no rootNav controls whether a nav file will be displayed or hidden on the docs site home page. It is enabled by default. If you want to hide a category from the home page (as we do for our style guide docs, for example), you would set this to false, as shown below: title: Style guide path: /docs/style-guide Copy children no This is hardly ever used. It indicates a sub-navigation node. Procedures Below are instructions for several common procedures. If you're doing a larger docs project, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the general docs site structure concepts. Procedures include: Overview of what a large docs site restructuring involves Add a new docs category Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Move docs between folders or categories Move or delete folders Create dummy docs Overview of steps for a large docs site restructure project For some smaller docs site edits, you can sometimes simply edit the nav files and not have to touch the doc files or folders. But for larger projects, you may want to or need to edit and move the docs files and folders themselves. Below is a broad overview of the chunks of work such larger projects generally entail. Plan out what the new nav file structure will look like, and plan out the work of moving docs files or creating new folders. It can help to write down the chunks of work a large project will entail. Move the affected doc files to their new folder locations, making sure to add redirects. For more on that, see Move docs between folders. Delete any empty folders. For any folder or file edits you do to the file structure itself (including file or folder renaming, moving files and folders, but not including editing of content or front matter within a doc or nav file), do the same edits to the folders and files in the i18n directory. Not all folders or files will be present in the i18n directory: it only populates an mdx file or an associated folder if that mdx file has been marked for translation. Edit the nav files to reflect the new desired structure and point to the new doc URLs. For more specific and granular procedures, keep reading. Add a new category of docs We'll explain two procedures: adding a sub-category of docs in an existing nav file, and adding an entirely new nav file: Add a new category to a nav file To add a new category to a nav file: In an existing nav file, add a new category, represented by its title. Add the docs you want in that section, emulating the format and indenting of other nav files. To learn more about how this works, see: How a doc's sidebar is determined How a doc category view is determined Add a new nav file Adding an entirely new nav file should be rare and something we only do occasionally during large overhauls of site structure. Adding new nav files should get sign-off from a docs site manager. To add an entirely new nav file: Copy an existing file nav file, or create a new nav file. Customize the new nav file with the categories and docs you want, using the standard nav file formatting and indenting. For more on structure, see nav format. Add a doc to sidebar/nav-file Once you create a doc, you need to place it in a nav file. Do not place a doc in more than one nav file location: if you require a link to a doc from a different category, attempt to place that reference within a relevant doc section. To add a doc to a nav file: In the nav file location where you want to locate it, add the title (its short title displayed in the sidebar and category views) and the path, which is the doc's URL. Ensure that you've emulated the standard nav file formatting and indenting. Move docs to other categories Because the nav file and the actual folder structure aren't connected, there are two different ways to \"move docs\": Move a doc in the nav files: preferred and most common procedure. Move a doc between folders: less frequent, mainly when doing larger projects where we want to do a significant overhaul of the docs structure and want to ensure the folder structure doesn't become too divergent from the nav file structure. Move docs using nav file Move a doc in the nav file when you want to change where it's visible in the sidebar menus. To move a doc from one place to another in the nav file: In the first nav file, copy the two rows representing that doc's entry (the title and path lines) and paste that content into the place you want it to live in the new nav file. In the new nav file section, make sure the formatting and indenting match standard nav file structure. See Nav format for more about nav file structure. Move a doc between folders Note that moving docs between the folders should be relatively rare. The main reasons to do this are when the folder structure and nav file structure are becoming quite divergent, which can be bad for a couple reasons: Too much divergence can create user confusion (for example, when the elements of the folder-based URL are very different than the nav-file-based location) or sub-optimal search engine results. Too much divergence can make it harder for us to find and edit docs, so there can be value to keeping things fairly up to date and parallel. When you move a doc between folders or rename a doc, that changes its URL (for more on why, see Understand structure). Similarly, if you rename a folder, that changes the URL of all docs in that area. To move a doc between folders: Get the current URL of the doc you want to move and add that URL to its own list of redirects. Tips: One way to do this in VSCode is to right click the file name and click \"Get relative path\". If you are moving many files, ask the team about our scripts for programmatically adding redirects to an entire doc directory. Be sure that redirect URLs don't have a trailing slash. Move the doc to its new folder location. If that mdx file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if it's marked for translation), make an equivalent move of that file in the i18n directory. Update nav files with the new URL. Having the correct doc URL in the nav file, and not a redirect, is important. Note that a doc's URL may be in more than one nav file so searching the site for that URL can help. Move or delete or rename a folder Sometimes when we are doing a larger restructuring project, we may want to move or delete or rename the actual folders instead of simply editing the nav files. Instructions for this: Because moving a folder or changing its name results in changing all the URLs of docs in that folder, you must first add redirects to the affected docs. You can do this manually (described in step #1 here) or you can use a script the docs team has for bulk-adding redirects to all the docs in a directory. Make the desired edit. For example, move the folder to the new location (dragging and dropping in the Finder window, for example), and/or rename the folder. If the edited folder is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if a doc in that folder has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that folder and its files in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. For deleting folders, you'll want to essentially follow the same steps as above: adding redirects for the mdx files being moved or deleted, then moving or deleting the docs, and then deleting the empty folders. Change a doc's file name Changing an mdx file's name results in its URL changing. Note that you can change a doc's displayed title in its front matter without changing the actual file name. Changing the file name can be useful. Instructions: Add a redirect to the doc whose file name you're changing. Change the file's name. If that file is present in the i18n directory (which it will be if that doc has been marked for translation), make an equivalent edit of that file's name in the i18n directory. Note: the i18n work is only necessary for movements or renaming of folders or files, not for editing of docs or nav file content. Create \"dummy\" docs We no longer want to have docs in multiple places in the nav files (although we still do have some docs that are like this). If you want a doc to be referenced in more than one location in the nav files, instead attempt to find a place within a doc where it makes sense to reference that doc.",
